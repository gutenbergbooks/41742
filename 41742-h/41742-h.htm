<p class="center p2">THE OLD PIKE.</p>

<p>The American aspiration has always been to go
westward. In the early history of the Republic the
Government gave great attention to the means of
reaching the Western frontier, then cut off by what
was regarded as the almost insurmountable barrier of
the Alleghenies. General Washington was the first
to project a chain of internal improvements across
the mountains, by the route of the Potomac to Cumberland,
then a Maryland frontier fort, and thence by
roads to the headwaters of the Ohio. The initial
enactment was procured by him from the Virginia
Legislature in 1774, for improving the navigation of
the Potomac; but the Revolutionary War interfered,
and he renewed the movement afterwards in 1784,
resulting in the charter of the Chesapeake and Ohio
Canal, of which Washington was the first President.
Little was done at that early period, however, in
building the canal, but the Government constructed
the famous "National Road," the first highway over
the Allegheny Mountains, from Cumberland in Maryland,
mainly through Southwestern Pennsylvania, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
Wheeling on the Ohio. This noted highway was
finished and used throughout in 1818, and, until the
railways crossed the mountains, it was the great route
of travel to the West. It was familiarly known as
the "Old Pike," and Thomas B. Searight has entertainingly
recorded its pleasant memories, for it has
now become mainly a relic of the past:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"We hear no more of the clanging hoof,</p>
<p class="i1">And the stage-coach, rattling by;</p>
<p>For the steam king rules the travelled world,</p>
<p class="i1">And the Old Pike's left to die."</p>
</div></div>

<p>He tells of the long lines of Conestoga wagons,
each drawn by six heavy horses, their broad wheels,
canvas-covered tops and huge cargoes of goods; of
the swaying, rushing mail passenger coach, the fleet-footed
pony express; the flocks of sheep and herds
of cattle, the droves of horses and mules sent East
from the "blue-grass" farms of Kentucky; and occasionally
of a long line of men and women, tied two
and two to a rope, driven by a slave-master from the
South, to be sold in the newer region of the Southwest.
He describes how the famous driver, Sam
Sibley, brings up his grand coach at the hotel in
Uniontown with the great Henry Clay as chief passenger,
and then after dinner whirls away with a
rush, but unfortunately, dashing over a pile of stone
in the road, the coach upsets. Out crawls the driver
with a broken nose, and a crowd hastens to rescue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
Mr. Clay from the upturned coach. He is unhurt,
and brushing the dust from his clothes says: "This
is mixing the Clay of Kentucky with the limestone
of Pennsylvania." Many are the tales of the famous
road. One veteran teamster relates his experience
of a night at the tavern on the mountain side&mdash;thirty
six-horse teams were in the wagon-yard, one hundred
mules in an adjoining lot, a thousand hogs in another,
as many fat cattle from the West in a field, and the
tavern crowded with teamsters and drovers&mdash;the
grunts of the hogs, the braying of the mules, the
bellowing of the cattle and the crunching and stamping
of the horses, "made music beyond a dream."
In 1846 the message arrived at Cumberland at two
o'clock in the morning that war was declared against
Mexico, and a noted driver took the news over the
mountains, past a hundred taverns and a score of villages,
one hundred and thirty-one miles to Wheeling,
in twelve hours. Over this famous road the Indian
chief Black Hawk was brought, but the harness
broke, the team ran away and the coach was smashed.
Black Hawk crept out of the wreck, stood up surprised,
and, wiping a drop of blood from his brow,
earnestly muttered, "Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!" Barnum
brought Jenny Lind over this road from Wheeling,
paying $17.25 fare apiece to Baltimore. Lafayette
came along it in 1825, the population all turning out
to cheer him. Andrew Jackson came over it four
years later to be inaugurated the first Western President,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
and subsequently also came Presidents Harrison,
Polk and Taylor. What was thought of the
"Old Pike" in its day of active service was well expressed
at a reception to John Quincy Adams. Returning
from the West, he arrived at Uniontown in
May, 1837, and was warmly welcomed. Hon. Hugh
Campbell, who made the reception address, said to the
ex-President: "We stand here, sir, upon the Cumberland
Road, which has broken down the great wall
of the Appalachian Mountains. This road, we trust,
constitutes an indissoluble chain of Union, connecting
forever, as one, the East and the West."</p>

<p>In the early part of the nineteenth century, Lancaster
in Pennsylvania was the largest inland city of
the United States. It is sixty-nine miles from Philadelphia,
and the "old Lancaster Road," the finest
highway of that period, was constructed to connect
them. This began the Pennsylvania route across the
Alleghenies to the West, which afterwards became
the most travelled. In 1834 the Pennsylvania Government
opened its State work, the Columbia Railroad
between the Delaware and the Susquehanna.
In 1836 there were four daily lines of stages running
in connection with this State railroad between Philadelphia
and Pittsburg, making the journey in sixty
hours. Gradually afterwards the Pennsylvania Railroad
was extended across the mountains, and the
Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was completed to
Wheeling, and they then took away the business
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
from the "Old Pike" and all the other wagon or
canal routes to the Ohio River.</p>

<p class="center p2">CHESTER AND LANCASTER VALLEYS.</p>

<p>Let us go westward across the Alleghenies by the
Pennsylvania route. East of the mountains it traverses
a rich agricultural region, limestone valleys,
intersected by running streams and enclosed between
parallel ridges of hills, stretching, like the mountain
ranges, across the country from northeast to southwest.
It is a land of prolific farms and dairies, and
for miles beyond Philadelphia the line is adjoined by
attractive villages and many beautiful suburban
villas. Three noted institutions of learning are
passed&mdash;Haverford College, the great Quaker College,
standing in an extensive wooded park; the
Roman Catholic Augustinian College at Villa Nova,
with its cross-surmounted dome and twin church
spires; and the Bryn Mawr College for women, one
of the most famous in the United States. This is a
region first settled by Welsh Quakers, and the name
Bryn Mawr is Welsh for the "great hill." It is a
wealthy and extensive settlement, and its College has
spacious buildings and over three hundred students.
At the Commencements they all join in singing their
impressive College hymn:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Thou Gracious Inspiration, our guiding star,</p>
<p>Mistress and Mother, all hail Bryn Mawr,</p>
<p>Goddess of wisdom, thy torch divine</p>
<p>Doth beacon thy votaries to thy shrine,</p>
<p>And we, thy daughters, would thy vestals be,</p>
<p>Thy torch to consecrate eternally."</p>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span></p>

<p>A few miles beyond is Paoli, preserving in its name
the memory of the Corsican patriot Paoli, and the
birthplace of the Revolutionary General "Mad Anthony"
Wayne. Here the British defeated the
American patriots in September, 1777. It stands on
the verge of one of the garden spots of Pennsylvania,
the Chester Valley, a charming region of broad
and smiling acres, bounded on the northwest by the
Welsh Mountain and Mine Hill, and a veritable land
of plenty. The Brandywine and Valley Creeks
water it, flowing out respectively to the Delaware
and the Schuylkill. Beyond the long ridge of Mine
Hill is Lancaster County, another land of rich farms,
with many miles of grain and tobacco fields. Mine
Hill is the watershed between the Delaware and the
Susquehanna, the fertile Pequea Valley being at its
western base. This is a great wheat country, and
from here was sent the first American grain across
the Atlantic to feed Europe, the Lancaster County
wheat, in the days before the railroads brought it
from the West, ruling prices for the American markets.
It was hauled out in the ponderous Conestoga
wagons, named after the Indian tribe which formerly
ruled this region&mdash;their name signifying "the great
magic land." They were a quarrelsome people,
fighting all the neighboring tribes, and becoming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
deadly foes of the whites. Repeated wars decimated
them, until in 1763 their last remnant, being hunted
almost to death, took refuge in the ancient jail at
Lancaster, and were cruelly massacred by the guerillas
called the "Paxton Boys."</p>

<p>In the midst of the wheat lands and bordering the
broad Conestoga Creek, flowing down to the Susquehanna
at Safe Harbor, is the city of Lancaster, its
red sandstone castellated jail being a conspicuous object
in the view. This city was originally called
Hickory Town, but in the eighteenth century its
loyal people christened it Lancaster, and named the
chief streets, intersecting at the Central Market
Square, King and Queen Streets, with Duke Street
parallel to the latter. Prior to 1812 it was the capital
of Pennsylvania. Lancaster is an attractive and
comfortable old city of thirty-five thousand population,
with many mills and factories and large tobacco
houses. It has a splendid Soldiers' Monument in the
Central Square, with finely sculptured guards, representing
each branch of the service, watching at the
base of the magnificent shaft. Upon the outskirts
are the ornate buildings of Franklin and Marshall
College, a foundation of the German Reformed
Church, and it also has a Theological Seminary. The
charm of Lancaster, however, is Woodward Hill
Cemetery, on a bold bluff, washed by the Conestoga
Creek, which forms a graceful circle around its base.
Upon the surface and sides of the bluff the graves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
are terraced. Here is the tomb of James Buchanan,
the only President sent from Pennsylvania, who died
in 1868, at his home of Wheatland on the outskirts
of the town. Another noted citizen of Lancaster
was Thaddeus Stevens, who long represented it in
Congress, and was the Republican leader in the
House of Representatives during the Civil War, and
afterwards until his death in 1868. He was the
great champion of the emancipation of the negro
race, and refused to be buried in the cemetery because
negroes were excluded. Upon the grave which
he selected in Lancaster are these words: "I repose
in this quiet and secluded spot, not from any natural
preference for solitude, but finding other cemeteries
limited by charter rules as to race. I have chosen it
that I might be enabled to illustrate in death the
principle which I have advocated through a long life
&mdash;equality of man before his Creator." When Lancaster
was the chief town of the Colonial frontier in
1753, it was the place where Braddock's unfortunate
expedition against Fort Duquesne at Pittsburg was
organized and equipped, the work being mainly directed
by Benjamin Franklin. Robert Fulton was
born in Lancaster County, and he grew up and was
educated at Lancaster, going afterwards to Philadelphia.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>The Susquehanna West of Falmouth</i></p>
</div>

<p class="center p2">THE SUSQUEHANNA RIVER.</p>

<p>The line westward from Lancaster crosses one
long ridge-like hill after another stretching broadly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
over the country, and finally comes to the outlying
ridge of the Allegheny range, the South Mountain,
beyond which is the great Appalachian Valley.
One railroad route boldly crosses this mountain
through the depressions in the Conewago hills, where
the picturesque Conewago Creek, the Indian "long
reach," flows down its beautiful gorge to the Susquehanna,
and this railroad finally comes out on that
river at Middletown below Harrisburg; the other
route follows a more easy gradient westward ten
miles to Columbia, and this is used by the heavier
freight trains. Coming towards it over the hills, the
wide Susquehanna lies low in its broad valley, enclosed
by the distant ridge of the Kittatinny bounding
Cumberland County beyond the river. As it is
approached, the thought is uppermost that this is one
of the noblest, and yet among the meanest rivers in
the country. Rising in Otsego Lake in New York,
it flows over four hundred miles down to Chesapeake
Bay, receives large tributaries, its West Branch
being two hundred miles long, rends all the Allegheny
Mountain chains, and takes a great part of
the drainage of that region in New York and Pennsylvania,
passes through grand valleys, noble gorges
and most magnificent scenery, and yet it is so thickly
sown with islands, rocks and sand-bars, rapids and
shallows, as to defy all attempts to make it satisfactorily
navigable excepting by lumber rafts, logs and
a few canal boats. Thus the Indians significantly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
gave its name meaning the island-strewn, broad and
shallow river, and it is little more than a gigantic
drain for Central Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>On its bank is Columbia, a town of busy iron and
steel manufacture, as the whole range of towns are
for miles up to and beyond Harrisburg. At Columbia
first appeared, about 1804, that mysterious agency
known as the "Underground Railroad," whereby
fugitive slaves were secretly passed from one "station"
to another from "Mason and Dixon's Line"
to Canada, mainly through the aid and active exertions
of philanthropic Quakers. All through Chester
and Lancaster Counties and northward were laid the
routes of this peculiar line, whose ramifications became
more and more extensive as time passed,
making the Fugitive Slave Law almost a nullity
during the decade before the Civil War. There were
hundreds of good people engaged in facilitating the
unfortunate travellers who fled for freedom, and
many have been the escapades with the slave-hunters,
whose traffic long ago happily ended. At
Middletown the Swatara River flows in from the hills
of Lebanon County, there being all along the Susquehanna
a prodigious development of the steel industry
as well as rich farms on the fertile bottom
lands. Here is the historic estate of Lochiel, which
was the home of Simon Cameron, who for many
years ruled the political destinies of Pennsylvania.
He was born in 1799 at Maytown, near Marietta, on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
the Susquehanna, a few miles above Columbia, in
humble circumstances, and came as a poor printer's
boy to Harrisburg, rose to wealth and power, and
when he was full of years and honors placed the
mantle of the United States Senatorship upon his
son. Their "Clan Cameron" which ruled Pennsylvania
for two generations has been regarded as the
best managed political "machine" in the Union,
having in its ranks and among its allies not only politicians,
but bankers, railway managers, merchants,
manufacturers and capitalists, and men in every walk
of life, ramifying throughout the Keystone State.</p>

<p>Harrisburg, the capital of Pennsylvania, stands
upon the sloping eastern bank of the river in the
grandest scenery. Just above, the Susquehanna
breaks through the Kittatinny at the Dauphin Gap,
giving a superb display of the rending asunder of
the towering mountain chain. Opposite are the
forest-clad hills of York and Cumberland bordering
the fertile Cumberland Valley spreading off to the
southwest, while behind the city this great Appalachian
Valley continues between its enclosing ridges
as the Lebanon Valley northeast to the Schuylkill
River at Reading. Market Street is the chief Harrisburg
highway, and the Pennsylvania Railroad is
the back border of the town. The State Capitol, set
on a hill, was burnt, and is being rebuilt. A pleasant
park encloses the site, and from the front a wide
street leads down to the river, making a pretty view,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
with a Soldiers' Monument in the centre, which is an
enlarged reproduction of Cleopatra's Needle. The
Front Street of the city, along the river bank, is the
popular promenade, and is adorned with the Executive
Mansion and other fine residences, which have a
grand outlook across the broad expanse of river and
islands. Bridges cross over, among them the old
"camel's back," a mile long, and having its shelving
stone ice-breakers jutting up stream. This is the
old wooden covered bridge that Charles Dickens
wrote about in his <i>American Notes</i>. On his first
American visit he came into Harrisburg from York
County on a stage-coach through this bridge, and he
wrote: "We crossed the river by a wooden bridge,
roofed and covered on all sides, and nearly a mile in
length. It was profoundly dark, perplexed with
great beams, crossing and re-crossing it at every possible
angle, and through the broad chinks and crevices
in the floor the river gleamed far down below,
like a legion of eyes. We had no lamps, and as the
horses stumbled and floundered through this place
towards the distant speck of dying light, it seemed
interminable. I really could not persuade myself at
first as we rumbled heavily on, filling the bridge with
hollow noises&mdash;and I held down my head to save it
from the rafters&mdash;but that I was in a painful dream,
and that this could not be reality." The old bridge
is much the same to-day as when Dickens crossed it.</p>

<p>Harrisburg was named for John Harris, who established
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
a ferry here, and alongside the river bank
is the little "Harris Park" which contains his grave.
The stump of the tree at the foot of which he was
buried is carefully preserved. A drunken band of Conestoga
Indians came this way in 1718, and, capturing
the faithful ferryman, tied him to the tree to be tortured
and burnt, when the timely interposition of
some Indians from the opposite shore, who knew him
and were friendly, saved him. His son succeeded
him and ran the ferry, and an enclosure in the park
preserves this spot of historic memory.</p>

<p class="center p2">LINCOLN'S MIDNIGHT RIDE.</p>

<p>It was from Harrisburg that Lincoln took the
famous secret midnight ride, "in long cloak and
Scotch cap," which enabled him to escape attack and
possible assassination when going to be inaugurated
President in 1861. Lincoln arrived in Philadelphia
on his way to Washington February 21st, and had
arranged to visit Harrisburg next day, address the
Pennsylvania Legislature, and then proceed to Washington
by way of Baltimore. In Philadelphia General
Scott and Senator Seward informed him that he
could not pass through Baltimore at the time announced
without great peril, and detectives who had
carefully examined the situation declared his life in
danger. Lincoln, however, could not believe that
anyone would try to assassinate him and made light
of the matter. On the morning of February 22d he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
raised a flag on Independence Hall in Philadelphia,
and then went by railway to Harrisburg. There his
friends again urged him to abandon his plan and
avoid Baltimore. He visited the Legislature, and
afterwards, at his hotel, met the Governor, several
prominent people being present, among them Colonel
Thomas A. Scott, then Vice-President of the Pennsylvania
Railroad. Again the subject was discussed,
and he was urged to avoid the danger threatening
next day, being reminded that the railway passenger
coaches were drawn through the Baltimore streets
by horses, thus increasing the chances of doing him
harm. He heard them patiently and answered,
"What would the nation think of its President stealing
into the Capital like a thief in the night?" But
they only the more strenuously insisted, and finally
he yielded, consenting to do whatever they thought
best. Colonel Scott undertook the task, and during
the early evening quietly arranged a special train to
take Lincoln to Philadelphia, where he would get
aboard the regular night express and be in Washington
by daylight. Colonel Ward H. Lamon, a personal
friend, was selected to attend Lincoln. As the
party left the hotel a large crowd cheered them, and
the Governor, Andrew G. Curtin, the better to conceal
the intention, called out in a loud voice, "Drive
us to the Executive Mansion." This was done, and
when they had got away from the crowd the carriage
was taken by a roundabout route to the station.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
Lincoln and Lamon were not noticed by the few people
there, and quietly entering the car, left for Philadelphia.
As soon as they had started Scott cut every
telegraph wire leading out of Harrisburg, so nothing
could be transmitted excepting under his control.
Lincoln got to Philadelphia without trouble, was put
aboard the express at midnight, and then at dawn
Scott reunited his wires and called up Washington, a
group of anxious men around him. Soon the message
came back, slowly ticked out from the instrument,
"Plums delivered nuts safely." Scott knew
what it meant; he jumped to his feet, threw up his
hat and shouted, "Lincoln's in Washington." The
Baltimore plotters were thus foiled, as the new President
passed quietly through that city before daylight,
and several hours earlier than they had expected
him.</p>

<p class="center p2">THE CUMBERLAND AND LEBANON VALLEYS.</p>

<p>Harrisburg stands in the centre of the great Appalachian
Valley, where it is bisected by the broad
Susquehanna. To the southwest it stretches away
to the Potomac as the Cumberland Valley, and to
the northeast it spreads across to the Schuylkill as
the fertile Lebanon Valley. The high mountain wall
of the Kittatinny bounds it on the northwest, with
all the rivers, as heretofore described, breaking out
through various "gaps." In the Colonial days, when
Indian forays were frequent, the Province of Pennsylvania
defended the entrances to this fertile valley
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
by a chain of frontier forts located at these gaps,
with attendant block-houses, each post garrisoned by
from twenty to eighty Provincial soldiers, as its importance
demanded. Benjamin Franklin, who was
then commissioned as a Colonel, was prominent in
the advocacy of these frontier defences, and he personally
organized the settlers and arranged the garrisons.
Fort Hyndshaw began the chain on the
Delaware, there were other forts on the Lehigh and
Schuylkill, and Fort Henry located on the Swatara,
now Lebanon, while just above Harrisburg was Fort
Hunter, commanding the passage of the Susquehanna
through the Dauphin Gap.</p>

<p>Over in the Cumberland Valley, about nineteen
miles from Harrisburg, is Carlisle, a town of some
nine thousand people, in a rich country, and the
chief settlement of that valley. Here is located in
what were formerly the army barracks, coming
down from the time when this was a frontier post,
the Government Indian Training School, where about
eight hundred Indian boys and girls are instructed,
being brought from the far western tribes to be
taught the arts and methods of civilization. These
Indian children are numerous in the streets and on
the railway trains, with their straight hair, round
swarthy faces and high cheek bones, and show the
surprising influence of a civilizing education in
humanizing their features and modifying their nomadic
traits. They have quite a noted military organization
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
and band at the School. Dickinson College,
a foundation of the Methodist Church, is at
Carlisle, having begun its work in 1783, when it was
named after John Dickinson, then the President of
Pennsylvania, who took great interest in it and made
valuable gifts. Among its graduates were President
James Buchanan and Chief Justice Roger B. Taney.
Carlisle was President Washington's headquarters in
1794, during the "Whisky Insurrection" in Western
Pennsylvania. After the United States Government
got fairly started, the Congress in 1791 imposed
a tax of seven cents per gallon on whisky.
This made a great disturbance among the frontier
settlers of Pennsylvania, who were largely Scotch-Irish,
the population west of the Kittatinny to the
Ohio River being then estimated at seventy thousand.
They had no market for their grain, but they
made it into whisky, which found ready sale. A
horse could carry two kegs of eight gallons each on the
bridle paths across the mountains, and it was worth a
dollar a gallon in the east. Returning, the horseback
load was usually iron worth sixteen cents a
pound, or salt at five dollars a bushel. Every farmer
had a still, and the whisky thus became practically
the money of the people on account of its purchasing
value. Opposition to the tax began in riots. A
crowd of "Whisky boys" from Bedford came into
Carlisle and burnt the Chief Justice in effigy, setting up
a liberty pole with the words "Liberty and No Excise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
on Whisky." President Washington called for troops
to enforce the law, and this angered them. One John
Holcroft, a ready writer, appeared, and wrote sharp articles
against the law and the army, over the signature
of "Tom the Tinker." These were printed in handbills,
and the historian says "half the trees in
Western Pennsylvania were whitened with Tom the
Tinker's notices." Officials sent to collect the tax
were roughly treated, farmers who paid it were
beaten by masked men, and one man who rented his
house to a tax collector was captured at midnight by
a crowd of disguised vigilants, who carried him into
the woods, sheared his hair, tarred, feathered and
tied him to a tree.</p>

<p>Soon there were gathered at Carlisle an army of
thirteen thousand men from Pennsylvania, New Jersey,
Maryland and Virginia, under Governor Henry
Lee of Virginia. President Washington and Secretary
of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton came to
Carlisle, and accompanied the troops, in October,
1794, on their march across the mountains to Bedford.
The Governors of New Jersey and Pennsylvania
led the troops of their respective States, and
in the army were many Revolutionary veterans. As
they advanced they found Tom the Tinker's notices
on the trees, of which the following is a specimen:</p>

<p>"Brethren, you must not think to frighten us with
fine arranged bits of infantry, cavalry and artillery,
composed of your watermelon armies taken from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
Jersey shores. They would cut a much better figure
in warring with crabs and oysters about the banks of
the Delaware. It is a common thing for Indians to
fight your best armies in the proportion of one to
five; therefore we would not hesitate to attack this
army at the rate of one to ten."</p>

<p>The soldiers riddled these notices with bullets and
pressed on, hunting for "Tom Tinker's men," as the
insurgents came to be called. But they never seemed
able to find them. All the people seen told how they
were forced by threats, and when asked where the
persons were who threatened them, replied, "Oh,
they have run off." The army finally reached Pittsburg,
the people submitted to the law and paid the
tax, the insurrection was suppressed, and the army
returned and was disbanded. The whisky excise
was peacefully collected afterwards until the tax was
repealed.</p>

<p>In the Lebanon Valley east of Harrisburg are important
iron furnaces, and here are the "Cornwall
Ore Banks," which is one of the greatest iron-ore
deposits in the world&mdash;less rich than some others,
possibly, but having a practically exhaustless supply
almost alongside these furnaces. There are three
hills of solid iron ore, one of them having been
worked long before the Revolution, the original furnace,
still existing, dating from 1742. This great
Cornwall iron mine was bought in 1737 for $675,
including a large tract of land. A half-century later
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
$42,500 was paid for a one-sixth interest, and to-day
a one-forty-eighth interest is estimated worth upwards
of $500,000. These ores have some sulphur
in them, and are therefore baked in ovens to remove
it. They yield about 50 per cent. of iron. A geologist
some time ago reported upon the ore banks that
there were thirty millions of tons of ore in sight
above the water-level, being over three times the
amount taken out since the workings began in the
eighteenth century. The deposits extend to a depth
of several hundred feet under the surface, thus indefinitely
multiplying the prospective yield.</p>

<p class="center p2">THE SUSQUEHANNA HEADWATERS.</p>

<p>Otsego Lake, the source of the Susquehanna
River, is one of the prettiest lakes in New York
State, and is at an elevation of eleven hundred
feet above tide. It is nine miles long and about a
mile wide, the Susquehanna issuing from its southern
end at Cooperstown, a hamlet of two thousand
people, beautifully situated amid the high rolling
hills surrounding the lake. The name of the lake
comes from the "Ote-sa-ga rock" at the outlet, a
small, round-topped, beehive-shaped boulder a few
rods from the shore, just where the lake condenses
into the river. This was the Indian Council rock, to
which they came to hold meetings and make treaties,
and it was well-known among the Iroquois and the
Lenni Lenapes. James Fenimore Cooper, the novelist,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
who has immortalized all this region, called
the lake the "Glimmerglass." His father, Judge
William Cooper, founded the village of Cooperstown
in 1786, afterwards bringing his infant son
from Burlington, New Jersey, where he was born in
1789. Here the great American novelist lived until
his death in 1851, his grave, under a plain horizontal
slab, being in the little churchyard of Christ
Episcopal Church. There is a monument to him in
Lakewood Cemetery, about a mile distant, surmounted
by a statue of his legendary hunter
"Leatherstocking," who has been described as "a
man who had the simplicity of a woodsman, the
heroism of a savage, the faith of a Christian, and the
feeling of a poet." The old Cooper mansion, his home,
Otsego Hall, was burnt in 1854, and its site is marked
by a rock in the middle of the road, surrounded by a
railing. "Hannah's Hill," named after his daughter,
and commanding a magnificent view, which he always
described with rapture, is on the western shore of the
lake, just out of town. The charm of Cooper's genius
and the magic of his description have given Otsego
Lake a world-wide fame. In one place he described
it as "a broad sheet of water, so placid and limpid
that it resembled a bed of the pure mountain atmosphere
compressed into a setting of hills and woods.
Nothing is wanted but ruined castles and recollections,
to raise it to the level of the scenery of the
Rhine." And thus has the poet sung of it:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"O Haunted Lake, from out whose silver fountains</p>
<p class="i1">The mighty Susquehanna takes its rise;</p>
<p>O Haunted Lake, among the pine-clad mountains,</p>
<p class="i1">Forever smiling upward to the skies,&mdash;</p>
<p>A master's hand hath painted all thy beauties;</p>
<p class="i1">A master's mind hath peopled all thy shore</p>
<p>With wraiths of mighty hunters and fair maidens,</p>
<p class="i1">Haunting thy forest-glades forevermore."</p>
</div></div>

<p>All around Otsego Lake and its neighborhood are
the scenes which Cooper has interwoven into his
novel, <i>The Deer-Slayer</i>. About seven miles northwest
are the well-known Richfield Springs (magnesia
and sulphur), near Candarago Lake. This Indian
name, meaning "on the lake," has recently been revived
to supersede the old title of Schuyler's Lake
for this beautiful sheet of water, enbosomed in green
and sloping hills, which is the chief scenic charm of
Richfield. To the eastward from Otsego Lake is the
romantic Cherry Valley, another attractive summer
resort, and the scene of a sad Indian massacre in
1778, the site of the old fort that was then captured
being still exhibited, with the graves of the murdered
villagers, to whom a monument has been erected. A
few miles farther, in a narrow upland wooded valley
surrounded by high hills, are the Sharon Springs
(sulphur and chalybeate), which in earlier times were
so popular with our German citizens, who were attracted
by the resemblance to the Fatherland, that
the place was called the "Baden-Baden of America."
The name of Sharon came from Sharon in Connecticut,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
and the spring water is discharged with a crust
of white and flocculent sulphur into a stream not inappropriately
called the Brimstone Brook. In this
valley, east of the springs, one of the last Revolutionary
battles was fought, Colonel Willett's American
force in 1781 routing a detachment of Tories and
Indians with severe loss. There are grottoes in the
neighborhood abounding in stalactites and beautiful
crystals of sulphate of lime. Not far away is the
noted Howe's Cave, an immense cavern, said to extend
for eleven miles underground, being an old
water-channel in the lower Helderberg limestone, and
which has many visitors, attracted by its fine display
of stalactites and grand rock chambers, with the
usual subterranean lake and stream. All this region
was originally settled by Germans from the Palatinate.</p>

<p>The Susquehanna, steadily gaining in volume,
flows in wayward course down rapids and around
many bends to Binghamton, near the southern border
of New York, where it receives the Chenango River,
and its elevation has declined to eight hundred and
sixty feet. This is a busy manufacturing city and
railway junction, having forty thousand inhabitants.
The first settlers came in 1787, and William Bingham
of Philadelphia owning the land at the confluence
of the rivers, the town was afterwards named
for him. The Chenango Canal connects the Susquehanna
waters from here with the Erie Canal, about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
ninety miles northward, at Utica, the Indian word Chenango
meaning "the bull thistle." Entering Pennsylvania,
the Susquehanna now flows many miles past
mountain and village, around great bends and breaking
through the Allegheny ridges, passes along the Wyoming
Valley, already described, and finally going out
through the Nanticoke Gap, reaches Northumberland,
where it receives its chief tributary, the West Branch.
This great stream comes for two hundred miles from
the westward through the Allegheny ranges, passing
Lewisburg, the seat of the Baptist University of
Lewisburg, Milton, and the noted lumber town of
Williamsport, famous for its great log boom. This
arrangement for collecting logs cost a million dollars,
and extends about four miles up the river above the
town, with its massive piers and braces, and will
hold three hundred millions of feet of lumber. The
river front is lined with basins and sawmills. In earlier
years this boom has been so filled with pine and hemlock
logs in the spring that the river could almost
anywhere be crossed on a solid floor of timber. Unfortunately,
however, the vast forests on the slopes
of the Alleghenies have been so generally cut off that
the trade has seriously declined. At Northumberland
lived Dr. Joseph Priestley, the discoverer of
oxygen gas, who died there in 1804, and is buried in
the cemetery.</p>

<p>The Susquehanna now becomes a broad river, and
just below flows past Sunbury, the railway outlet of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
the extensive Shamokin coal district. This town
was originally Fort Augusta, built in 1756 to guard
the Susquehanna frontier just below the junction of
its two branches. In the French and Indian War
it had usually a garrison of a regiment, and it was
then regarded as the best defensive work in Pennsylvania.
After that war it gradually fell into decay,
although during the Revolution it was always a
refuge for the Susquehanna frontier settlers fleeing
from Indian brutality and massacre. Many prominent
officers of the Revolutionary army received
their military training at this fort. The settlement
was originally called Shamokin, from the Indian
name of the creek here falling into the Susquehanna&mdash;Schakamo-kink,
meaning, like Shackamaxon, "the
place of eels." For fifty miles below Sunbury the
broad Susquehanna winds among the mountain
ranges, traversing one after another, until its channel
is narrowed to pass through the great Dauphin Gap
in the Kittatinny, five miles above Harrisburg, where
the river bed has descended to an elevation of three
hundred and twenty feet above tide.</p>

<p class="center p2">THE BEAUTIFUL BLUE JUNIATA.</p>

<p>A long, low bridge carries the Pennsylvania Railroad
across the river in front of Dauphin Gap, and a
short distance above, in a delta of fertile islands, the
Susquehanna receives its romantic tributary, the
Juniata, flowing for a hundred miles from the heart
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
of the Alleghenies, and breaking out of them through
a notch cut down in the long ridge of the Tuscarora
Mountain. Here is the iron-making town of Duncannon,
settled by the sturdy Scotch-Irish, who were
numerous along the Juniata and in its neighboring
valleys, and who suffered greatly from Indian forays
in the early days of the frontier. Upon Duncan's
Island, the chief one in the delta, at the mouth of the
Juniata, was the place of the council-fire of the Indian
tribes of all this region. Now, this island is
mainly a pleasure-ground, having spacious and shady
groves, while the canal, crossing it from the Susquehanna
to the Juniata, goes directly through an extensive
Indian mound and burial-place. We will enter
the fastnesses of the Alleghenies by the winding
gorge of the "beautiful blue Juniata," flowing
through magnificent scenery from the eastern face
of the main Allegheny range out to the great river.
It breaks down ridge after ridge, stretching broadly
across the country, and presents superb landscapes
and impressive mountain views. The route is a
series of bends and gorges, the river crossing successive
valleys between the ridges, now running for
miles northeast along the base of a towering mountain
and then turning east or southeast to break
through it by a romantic pass. The glens and mountains,
with ever-changing views, give an almost endless
panorama. Softness of outline, massiveness and
variety, are the peculiarities of Juniata scenery. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
stream is small, not carrying a great amount of water
in ordinary seasons, and it seems as much by strategy
as by power to have overcome the obstacles and made
its mountain passes. The rended mountains, steep
tree-covered slopes and frequent isolated sentinel-like
hills rising from the glens, have all been moulded into
rounded forms by the action of the elements, leaving
few abrupt precipices or naked rocks to mar the regularity
of the natural beauties. The valleys and lower
parts of the mountain sides are generally cultivated,
the fields sloping up to the mantle of forest crowning
the flanks and summits of the ridges. Every change
of sunshine or shadow, and the steady progress of
the seasons, give new tints to these glens and mountains.
At times the ravines are deep and the river
tortuous, and again it meanders across the rich flat
bottom lands of a broad valley. In its winding course
among these mountain ranges, this renowned river
passes through and displays almost the whole geological
formation of Pennsylvania. The primary
rocks are to the eastward of the Susquehanna, and
the bituminous coal measures begin on the western
Allegheny slope, so that the river cuts into a rock
stratification over six miles in thickness, as one after
another formation comes to the surface.</p>

<p>We go through the narrow Tuscarora Gap, and
are journeying over the lands of the Tuscaroras, one
of the Iroquois Six Nations, who came up from the
South, and were given the name of Tuscarora, or the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
"shirt-wearer," because long contact with the whites
had led them to adopt that garment. Beyond the
Gap, the Tuscarora Valley is enclosed on its northwest
side by the Turkey Mountain, the next western
ridge, and it was a region of terrible Indian conflicts
and massacres in the pioneer days, when the first fort
built there was burnt, and every settler either killed
or carried off into captivity. Here was fought the
"Grasshopper War" between the Tuscaroras and
Delawares. They had villages on opposite sides of
the river, and one day the children disputed about
some grasshoppers. The quarrel involved first the
squaws and then the men, a bloody battle following.
Mifflin, an attractive town, is located here, and to the
westward the Juniata breaks through the next great
ridge crossing its path, passing a massive gorge
formed by the Shade and Blue Mountains, flowing for
miles in the deep and narrow winding canyon between
them, the far-famed "Lewistown or Long
Narrows," having the railway hanging upon one
bank and the canal upon the other. Broken, slaty
shingle covers most of the hill-slopes, and in the broad
valley, above the lengthened gorge, is Lewistown,
nestling at the base of a huge mountain at the outlet
of the beautiful Kishicoquillas Valley, spreading up
among the high hills to the northward&mdash;its name
meaning "the snakes are already in their dens."
The hero of this attractive region in the eighteenth
century, and then its most distinguished inhabitant,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
was Logan, the chief of the Mingoes and Cayugas,
whose speeches, preserved by Thomas Jefferson, are
a favorite in school declamation. He was of giant
mould, nearly seven feet high, and lived at Logan's
Spring in the valley. He was the friend of the
white men, but when the frontier became too well
settled for him longer to find the deer on which he
subsisted, selling their skins to the traders, he went
westward to the Ohio River, locating near Wheeling.
Here, without provocation, his family were cruelly
massacred, and this ended Logan's love for the
whites. He became a relentless foe, wreaking indiscriminate
vengeance, until killed in the Shawnee
wars beyond the Ohio, having joined that hostile
tribe. The Lewistown Narrows are the finest mountain
pass of the Juniata, the peaks precipitously
rising over a thousand feet above the river, which
forces a passage between them for more than eight
miles, the densely wooded cliffs so enclosing and
overshadowing the gorge as to give it an appearance
of deepest gloom.</p>

<p class="center p2">THE STANDING STONE AND SINKING SPRING.</p>

<p>Westward beyond the valley rises the next ridge
pierced by the Juniata in its outflow, Jack's Mountain,
and its gorge is known as "Jack's Narrows."
Here penetrated Captain Jack Armstrong in the
early colonial days, a hunter and Indian trader, whose
cabin was burnt and wife and children massacred,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
making him always afterwards an avenging Nemesis,
roving along the Juniata Valley and killing Indians
indiscriminately. Jack's Narrows is a pass even
more contracted than that below Lewistown, and a
profusion of shingle and broken stone covers its
mountain sides, the deranged limestone strata in
places standing almost upright. Mount Union is in
the valley east of this pass, and beyond it is the
chief town of the Juniata, Huntingdon, which has
about eight thousand people. This was the oldest
settlement on the river, ninety-seven miles west of
Harrisburg, the ancient "Standing Stone," where the
Indians of the valley for centuries met to hold their
councils. The earliest white settlers came in 1754.
The original Standing Stone of Huntingdon, erected
by the Indians, was a granite column, about fourteen
feet high and six inches square, covered with strange
characters, which were the sacred records of the
Oneidas. Once the Tuscaroras stole it, but the
Oneidas followed, and, fighting for their sacred
treasure, recaptured it. When the whites came
along, the Oneidas, who had joined the French, went
west, carrying the stone with them. Afterwards, a
second stone, much like the first, was set up, and a
fragment of it is now preserved at Huntingdon.
Here was built a large fort anterior to the Revolution,
which was a refuge for the frontier settlers.
The "Standing Stone" is engraved as an appropriate
symbol on the city seal of Huntingdon, being surrounded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
by a representation of mountains, and the
name of "Oneida" (the granite) is preserved in a
township across the river. Selina, the Countess of
Huntingdon, who was a benefactor of the University
of Pennsylvania, had her titled name given the city.
The then University Provost, Dr. William Smith,
became owner of the town site, and thus remembered
her generosity. About fifty miles southwest of Huntingdon,
amid the mountains, is Bedford, noted for its
chalybeate and sulphur springs, discovered in 1804,
which have long been a favorite resort of Pennsylvanians
on account of their healing waters. The
whole country thereabout is filled with semi-bituminous
coal measures, furnishing a lucrative traffic.</p>

<p>Diminishing in volume, our attractive Juniata
flows through a rough country above Huntingdon,
after threading the pass in the lofty Warrior Ridge.
Extending off to the southwestward is Morrison's
Cove, a rich valley under the shadow of the long
mountain ridge, which was settled in 1755 by the
Dunkards. These singular people, among whose cardinal
doctrines are peace and non-resistance, were attacked
by the Indians in 1777, who entered the valley
and almost exterminated the settlement. Most
of them bowed submissively to the stroke of death,
gently saying "Gottes wille sei gethan" (God's will
be done). One, however, resisted, killed two Indians
and escaped; but afterwards returning, the
Dunkard Church tried him for this breach of faith,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
and he was excommunicated. In this region is the
Sinking Spring, a strange water course originally appearing
in a limestone cave, where it comes out of an
arched opening, with sufficient water to turn a large
mill; but it soon disappears underground, the concealed
current being heard through fissures, bubbling
far below. Then it returns to the surface, flowing
some distance, enters another cave, passing under
Cave Mountain, and finally reappears and falls into
the Juniata, making, in its peculiar waywardness, as
remarkable a stream as can anywhere be found.
Here our famous Juniata River, dwindled to a little
creek, comes down the mountain side, and we penetrate
farther by following up the Little Juniata. It
has brought us, through the great ridges, into the
heart of the Appalachian region, to the eastern base
of the main Allegheny Mountain, on the flanks of
which are its sources. It has displayed to us a noted
valley, full of the story of early Colonial contests,
massacres and perils, the scenes of the fearless missionary
labors of Brainerd the Puritan and Loskiel
the Moravian. Brainerd recognized the pagan idolatry
of the Indians, and did not hesitate to take the
Bible to their solemn religious festivals and expound
its divine principles, to spoil the incantations and
frustrate the charms of their medicine men. Once
a Nanticoke pontiff got into a hot argument with
Brainerd, saying God had taught him religion and
he would never turn from it; that he would not believe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
in the Devil; and he added that the souls of
the dead passed to the South, where the good lived
in a fair city, while the evil hovered forever in outer
darkness. Many are the romances of the attractive
Juniata:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Gay was the mountain song</p>
<p class="i1">Of bright Alfarata,</p>
<p>Where sweep the waters of</p>

<p>'Strong and true my arrows are,</p>
<p class="i1">In my painted quiver,</p>
<p>Swift goes my light canoe</p>
<p class="i1">Adown the rapid river.'"</p>
</div></div>

<p class="center p2">CROSSING THE MOUNTAIN TOP.</p>

<p>At the eastern base of the main Allegheny range
a long mountain valley stretches broadly from the far
northeast to the southwest, and here is Tyrone, a settlement
of extensive iron works, and the outlet of
the greatest bituminous coal-fields of Central Pennsylvania,
the Clearfield district, the town of Clearfield
being about forty miles to the northwest. Northeast
of Tyrone, this valley is called the Bald Eagle Valley,
a picturesque and fertile region; and to the
southwest it is the Tuckahoe Valley. At the base
of the Bald Eagle Mountain, thirty-three miles from
Tyrone, is the town of Bellefonte, another iron region,
handling the products of the Bald Eagle and
Nittany Valleys, and receiving its name from the
"Beautiful Fount" which supplies the town with
water. This is one of the most remarkable springs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
in the Alleghenies, pouring out two hundred and
eighty thousand gallons of the purest water every
minute. Following the Tuckahoe Valley southward,
at the base of the main Allegheny range we come to
the Pennsylvania Railroad town of Altoona, and
eight miles farther to Hollidaysburg. Each is a representative
town&mdash;Hollidaysburg of the past methods
of crossing the mountain top, and Altoona of the
present.</p>

<p>In 1836 Mr. David Stephenson, the famous British
railway engineer, made a journey across Pennsylvania
by the methods then in vogue, and wrote that he
travelled from Philadelphia to Pittsburg, three hundred
and ninety-five miles by the route taken, in
ninety-one hours, at a cost of three pounds sterling,
about four cents a mile, and that one hundred and
eighteen miles of the journey, which he calls "extraordinary,"
were by railroads, and two hundred and
seventy-seven miles by canals. This was the line
used for twenty years, a main route of travel from
the seaboard to the West, having been put into operation
in 1834. It followed the Columbia Railroad
from Philadelphia to Columbia on the Susquehanna,
the canal up the Susquehanna and Juniata Rivers to
Hollidaysburg, a portage railroad by inclined planes
over the main Allegheny Mountain ridge to Johnstown,
and the canal again, down the Conemaugh and
Allegheny Rivers to Pittsburg. There were one
hundred and seventy-two miles of canal from Columbia
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
to Hollidaysburg, which went through more than
a hundred locks and crossed thirty-three aqueducts,
having risen about six hundred feet above the level
at Columbia when it reached the eastern face of the
mountain. The canal west of Johnstown was one
hundred and five miles long, descended sixty-four
locks, and went through a tunnel of one thousand feet.
The Portage Railroad of thirty-six miles crossed the
mountain by Blair's Gap, above Hollidaysburg, at
twenty-three hundred and twenty-six feet elevation,
through a tunnel nine hundred feet long. There
were ten inclined planes, five on each side. The
steepest side of the Allegheny Mountain being its
eastern face, the railway from Hollidaysburg to the
summit, though only ten miles long, ascended fourteen
hundred feet, while twenty miles of railway on
the western side descended eleven hundred and
seventy-two feet. The cars hauled up the planes
each carried three tons of freight, and three cars
were hauled at a single draft. There could be
twenty-four cars carrying seventy-two tons passed
over in one hour, which was ample for the traffic at
that time, the average business being three hundred
tons of freight a day. This amount would be carried
in less than ten of the big cars of to-day. It
took passengers eight hours to go over the mountain,
halting one hour on the summit for dinner.</p>

<p>This route was superseded by the Pennsylvania
Railroad crossing above Altoona, opened in 1854, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
road made for ordinary trains; and then Hollidaysburg
became a town of iron manufacture, losing the
bustle and business of the Portage, which was abandoned.
The railroad company acquired a large tract
of land between the main Allegheny range and the
Brush Mountain to the southward, which has a deep
notch, called the "Kettle," cut down into it, opening
a distant prospect of gray mountain ridges behind.
Here has been established the most completely representative
railway city in the world, having enormous
railway shops, a gigantic establishment, and a
population of thirty-five thousand, almost all in one
way or another dependent on the Pennsylvania Railroad.
Altoona is at an elevation of about eleven
hundred feet above tide, and the railway climbs to
the summit of the mountain by a grade of ninety
feet to the mile, winding around an indented valley
to get the necessary elevation. At its head this valley
divides into two smaller glens, with a towering
crag rising between them. Having ascended the
northern side, the railway curves around, crossing
the smaller glens upon high embankments, doubling
upon itself, and mounting steadily higher by running
up the opposite side of the valley to the outer edge
of the ridge. This sweeping curve gives striking
scenic effects, and is the noted Pennsylvania "Horse
Shoe," and the huge crag between the smaller glens,
in which the head of the Horse Shoe curve is partly
hewn, is Kittanning Point. This means the "great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
stream," two creeks issuing out of the glens uniting
below it; and here was the route, at sixteen hundred
feet elevation, of the ancient Indian trail across the
mountain, the "Kittanning Path," in their portage
between the Juniata and Ohio waters. It shows how
closely the modern railroad builder has followed the
route set for him by the original road-makers among
the red men. The Pennsylvania Railroad carries
four tracks over the mountain, piercing the summit
by two tunnels at about twenty-two hundred feet elevation,
with two tracks in each. The mountain rises
much higher, and has coal mines, coke ovens and
miners' cabins on the very top. This is the watershed
dividing the Atlantic waters from those of the
Mississippi, flowing to the Gulf, and Gallitzin, a flourishing
mining village, is the summit station of the
railway.</p>

<p class="center p2">GOING DOWN THE CONEMAUGH.</p>

<p>In the latter part of the eighteenth century there
were but two white men living in all this region.
The first one there was Thomas Blair, whose cabin
was on the mountain at Blair's Gap, where the Portage
Railroad afterwards came over. The other was
Michael Maguire, who came along in 1790, and
going through the Gap, concluded to settle among
the Indians about twelve miles away, at what was
afterwards Loretto. These rugged pioneers spent
most of their time fighting and watching the Indians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
and wild beasts, and gathered a few companions
around them. Here afterwards came Prince Demetrius
Augustine Gallitzin, who left the Russian
army in 1792 and visited America, designing to
travel. He became a Catholic priest, and liking
these mountains, established a mission at Loretto in
1798, spending a fortune in maintaining it, his missionary
charge ultimately extending over the whole
mountain region. He attracted a population of about
three thousand, chiefly Germans and Irish, repeatedly
refused the episcopacy, and continued his labors until
his death at Loretto in 1840. His remains lie in
front of his church, surmounted by a monument,
while the centenary of this St. Michael's Church of
Loretto was marked in October, 1899, by erecting
his bronze statue, the Prelate-Prince Gallitzin being
portrayed as he appeared in the Allegheny wilderness,
wearing cassock, surplice and a skull-cap in
lieu of the beretta, this being his usual head-gear at
service. Loretto, named after the city on the Adriatic,
was the first nucleus of population in this elevated
district, and is about five miles north of the
railway. Loretto was the first settlement in this region,
but afterwards the coal and iron attracted the
Welsh, who came in numbers, and founded the town
of Ebensburg, about eleven miles from the railway.
They gave their familiar name of Cambria to the
county. Here on the mountain side, at an elevation
of over two thousand feet, are the Cresson Springs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
a noted health resort, with a half-dozen medicinal
springs, the chief being an astringent chalybeate and
a strong alum.</p>

<p>The route west of the mountain is down the valley
of the Conemaugh, in a district underlaid with coal,
and having at every village evidence of this industry.
The Conemaugh is "the other stream" of the Indians,
and winding down its tortuous valley, with
coal and iron all about, the railway comes to the settlement
of Conemaugh, which spreads into the larger
town of Johnstown, the seat of the great Cambria
Steel Works. The Conemaugh Valley is a deep
canyon, and Conemaugh village was the western terminus
of the mountain portage, where the canal
began. A little flat space about a mile beyond, at
the junction of Stony Creek, was in early times an
Indian village, then known from its sachem as "Kickenapawling's
Old Town." When the white men ventured
over the mountain, there came among them a
hardy German pioneer named Joseph Jahns, who
built a log cabin on the flat in 1791, and from him
the cluster of little houses that grew afterwards became
known as Jahnstown. Then came the Welsh
miners and iron-workers, and they set up charcoal
furnaces, and soon changed the name to Johnstown.
From this humble beginning grew the largest iron
and steel establishment in Pennsylvania. Its ores,
coal and limestone were originally all dug out of the
neighboring ridges, though now it uses Lake Superior
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
ores. The Conemaugh Valley is here enclosed
by high hills, and in the centre of the town the railroad
is carried across the river on a solid stone bridge
with low arches.</p>

<p>This region, on May 31, 1889, was the scene of
one of the most appalling disasters of modern times.
A deluge of rain for the greater part of two days had
fallen upon the Alleghenies, and made great freshets
in both the Juniata and the Conemaugh. On the
South Fork of the Conemaugh, fifteen miles above
Johnstown, is Conemaugh Lake, a reservoir there
formed by damming the stream, so that it covered a
surface of five hundred acres&mdash;the dam, a thousand
feet long, being in places one hundred feet high. This
had been made as a fishing-ground by a club of Pittsburg
anglers. The excessive rains filled the lake,
and the weakened dam burst, its twenty millions of
tons of waters rushing down the already swollen Conemaugh
in a mass a half-mile wide stretching across
the valley and forty to fifty feet high, carrying everything
before it. The lake level was about three hundred
feet higher than Johnstown, and every village,
tree, house, and the whole railway, with much of the
soil and rocks, were carried before the resistless flood
to Johnstown, where the mass was stopped by and
piled up behind the stone railway bridge, and there
caught fire, the resistless flood, to get out, sweeping
away nearly the whole town in the valley bottom.
This vast calamity destroyed from three to five thousand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
lives, for no accurate estimate could be ever
made, and ten millions of property. It took the flood
about seven minutes of actual time to pass over the
fifteen miles between the lake and Johnstown, and
there was left, after it had passed, a wide bed, like a
great Alpine glacial <i>moraine</i>, filled with ponderous
masses of sand and stones and wreckage of every
description, the resistless torrent being afterwards reduced
to a little stream of running water. It required
many months to recover from this appalling destruction;
but the people went to work with a will and rebuilt
the town, the steel works and the railway, which
for a dozen miles down the valley had been completely
obliterated. This terrible disaster excited
universal sympathy, and a relief fund amounting to
nearly $3,000,000 was contributed from all parts of
the world.</p>

<p class="center p2">LIGONIER AND HANNASTOWN.</p>

<p>The whole mountain district west of Johnstown is
filled with coal mines, coke ovens and iron furnaces,
this being the "Pittsburg Coal District." The Conemaugh
breaks through the next western ridge, the
Laurel Mountain, and the broadening river winds
along its deep valley between high wooded hills. It
is a veritable "Black Country," and ten miles beyond,
the river passes the finest mountain gorge on the
western slope of the Alleghenies, the deep and winding
canyon of the Packsaddle Narrows, by which the
Conemaugh breaks out of the Chestnut Ridge, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
western border of the Allegheny ranges. For two
hundred miles the railroad has gone through or over
range after range, and this grand pass, encompassed
by mountains rising twelve hundred feet above the
bottom of the gorge, is the impressive exit at the
final portal. The main railroad then leaves the
Conemaugh, and goes off southwestward along the
slope of Chestnut Ridge towards Greensburg and
Pittsburg. The river unites with the Loyalhanna
Creek below, and then flows as the Kiskiminetas
down to the Allegheny. The name of Loyalhanna
means the "middle stream," while the tradition is
that an impatient Indian warrior, anxious to move
forward, shouted in the night to his comrades encamped
on the other river&mdash;"Giesh-gumanito"&mdash;"let
us make daylight"&mdash;and from this was derived
its name of Kiskiminetas. A branch railroad from
here goes to Blairsville, named in memory of the
solitary pioneer of Blair's Gap, and another northward
leads to the town of Indiana. The great Chestnut
Ridge which the main railway runs along, gradually
descending the slope, is the last mountain the westbound
traveller sees until he reaches the Rockies.
For seventy miles to the southwestward the Chestnut
Ridge and Laurel Mountain extend in parallels, their
crest lines being almost exactly ten miles apart, and
enclosing the Ligonier Valley, out of which flows
northward the Loyalhanna Creek, breaking through
the Chestnut Ridge. Near this pass in 1757 was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
built Fort Ligonier, another of the frontier outposts
which resisted the incursions of the French and Indians,
who then held all the country to the westward.
In the Chestnut Ridge at Hillside is the "Great
Bear Cave," an extensive labyrinth of passages and
spacious chambers stretching more than a mile underground,
which, like most such places, has its subterranean
river and its tale of woe. A young girl,
stolen by gypsies, to escape from them took refuge
in this cave, and losing her way, perished, her bones
being found years afterwards. Explorers since have
always unwound balls of twine in this labyrinth, to be
able to retrace their steps.</p>

<p>In a good farming district of the Westmoreland
region is Greensburg, another railway junction where
branches go southward to the Monongahela coalfields.
Robert Hanna built a house near here in the
eighteenth century, around which gathered some
thirty log cabins, and the place in course of time became
known as Hannastown, prominent in the early
history of Western Pennsylvania. Here was held
the first court convened west of the Alleghenies, and
here were passed the patriotic resolutions of May 16,
1775, upon receipt of the news of the battle of Lexington
at the opening of the Revolution, which
sounded the keynote for the Declaration of Independence
the following year. Here also first appeared
during the Revolution General Arthur St.
Clair, an immigrant from Scotland, the grandson of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
the Earl of Roslyn, who lived in an humble house on
Chestnut Ridge. He served in the French and Indian
wars, and was the British commander at Fort
Ligonier. Horrible Indian massacres and terrible
retributions by the settlers were the chief features
of the Revolutionary War in Westmoreland. At its
close, the whites sent an expedition in 1782 against
the Wyandottes, which was defeated. The savages
soon wreaked fearful vengeance, raiding the region
in July of that year and burning Hannastown, which
was never rebuilt. Greensburg appeared soon afterwards,
however, and in 1875 it celebrated the centenary
of the Hannastown resolutions with patriotic
spirit. In its Presbyterian churchyard lie the remains
of General St. Clair, who, after founding and
naming the city of Cincinnati, returned here, and
died in 1818, at the age of eighty-four, in his lonely
cabin on Chestnut Ridge, in unmerited poverty and
obscurity. The stone over his grave has this significant
inscription: "The earthly remains of General
Arthur St. Clair are deposited beneath this
humble monument, which is erected to supply the
place of a nobler one due from his country." Being
in a region of fine agriculture and prolific mines,
Greensburg is a prosperous and wealthy town.</p>

<p class="center p2">BRADDOCK'S DEFEAT.</p>

<p>Natural gas is added to coal and coke in the region
beyond Greensburg, and the villages display
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
flaring gas torches at night for street lamps. The
whole country, north, south and west, is a network of
railways and a maze of mines, having long rows of
burning coke ovens lighting the sky with their lurid
glare. Here are mined the Westmoreland gas coals.
The valley of the Monongahela River, coming up
from West Virginia, approaches from the southward,
a great highway for coal boats out to the Ohio and
the West, also receiving a large coal tribute from its
branch, the Youghiogheny, flowing by crooked
course through Fayette County. Alongside the
Monongahela is the great Edgar Thomson Steel
Works, one of the chief establishments of the Carnegie
Steel Company, making railway rails. Here is
the famous Colonial battlefield of Western Pennsylvania,
made immortal by General Braddock's defeat
in July, 1755. This region was then a thick forest,
through which an Indian trail coming over the Monongahela
led to the junction of the two rivers forming
the Ohio, where the French had established their
stockade and trading post of Fort Duquesne. Braddock
came into this region from beyond the mountains,
his object being the capture of the fort. His
defeat, a great event in our Colonial history, was due
to his ignorance of the methods of Indian fighting
and his refusal to listen to those who understood it;
but he paid the penalty with his life, being shot, as
was believed at the time, by one of his own men,
after having had five horses shot under him. It was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
in rallying the defeated remnant that Washington,
the senior surviving officer, won his first military
laurels. Braddock crossed the river and was caught
in an ambuscade, eight hundred and fifty French and
Indians surprising and defeating his force of about
twenty-five hundred British regulars and Virginia
Provincial troops, the loss being nearly eight hundred.
Washington led the remnant back to Virginia,
carrying Braddock about forty miles on the
retreat, when he died. He was buried at night in
the centre of the road, Washington reading the Episcopal
burial service by torchlight, and the defeated
army marched over the grave to conceal its location
from the enemy. A handsome monument is erected
on the battlefield at Braddock's. And thus, through
iron mills and coal mines, amid smoke and busy industry,
the Pennsylvania Railroad enters Pittsburg,
the "Iron City."</p>

<p class="center p2">THE GREAT IRON CITY.</p>

<p>The Monongahela River coming from the southward,
and the Allegheny River flowing from the
northward, drain the western defiles of the Alleghenies,
and at Pittsburg unite to form the Ohio River.
Each comes to the junction through a deeply-cut
canyon, and at the confluence is a triangular flat upon
which the original town was built. Like most American
rivers, all these have names of Indian origin.
Monongahela is the "river of high banks, breaking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
off in places and falling down." Ohio is a Seneca
word, originally pronounced "O-hee-o," and meaning
the "beautiful river" or the "fair water," and Allegheny
in the language of the Delawares has much
the same signification, meaning "the fairest stream."
All the Indians regarded the two as really the same
river, of which the Monongahela was a tributary.
The first white men exploring this region were the
French, who came down from the lakes and Canada,
when they spread through the entire Mississippi
Valley. In 1753, however, Washington with a surveying
party was sent out by Virginia and carefully
examined the site of Pittsburg, advising, on his return,
that a fort should be built there to check the advance
of the French, and the next year this was
done. Scarcely was it completed, however, when
the French sent a summons to surrender, addressed
"From the Commander-in-chief of His Most Christian
Majesty's troops now on the Beautiful River to
the Commander of those of Great Britain." A
French force soon appeared, and the fort was abandoned.
This began the French and Indian Colonial
War that continued seven years, the French then
erecting their famous fort and trading-post guarding
the head of the Ohio, which they named after the
great French naval commander of the seventeenth
century, Marquis Abraham Duquesne. Then came
Braddock's defeat in 1755, and for some time the region
was quiet. Moravian missionary influence, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
had by 1758 detached many of the Indians
from the French interest, and after another British
attack and repulse, General Forbes came with a
large force, and the French abandoned the fort and
blew it up. Immediately rebuilt by the English, a
Virginia garrison occupied the post, and it was
named Fort Pitt. Then a larger fort was built at a
cost of $300,000 and garrisoned by artillery, which
the enemy vainly besieged in 1763. The next year
a town site was laid out near the fort, and in 1770 it
had twenty log houses. After the long succession of
wars and massacres on that frontier had ceased, the
village grew, and business began developing&mdash;at
first, boat- and vessel-building, and then smelting
and coal mining and the manufacture of glass. In
1812 the first rolling-mill started, and the war with
England in that year caused the opening of a cannon
foundry, which became the Fort Pitt Iron Works.
The village of Fort Pitt had become Pittsburg, and
expanded vastly with the introduction of steam, and
it became an extensive steamboat builder for the
Western waters. Railroad connections gave it renewed
impetus; natural gas used as a manufacturing
fuel was a wonderful stimulant; and it now conducts
an enormous trade with all parts of the country, and
is the seat of the greatest iron, steel and glass industries
in America.</p>

<p>Few views are more striking than that given from
the high hills overlooking Pittsburg. Rising steeply,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
almost from the water's edge, on the southern bank
of the Monongahela River, is Mount Washington,
three hundred and fifty feet high. Inclined-plane
railways are constructed up the face of this hill, and
mounting to the top, there is a superb view over the
town. The Allegheny River comes from the northeast
and the Monongahela from the southeast, through
deep and winding gorges cut into the rolling tableland,
and uniting form the Ohio, flowing away to the
northwest also through a deep gorge, although its
bordering ridges of hills are more widely separated.
Pittsburg stands upon the low flat surface of the
peninsula, above the junction of the rivers, which has
some elongated ridgy hills, stretching eastward
through the centre. Its situation and appearance
have thus not inaptly been compared to a flatiron,
the point being at the head of the Ohio, and these
ridgy hills making the handle. The city has overflowed
into extensive suburbs across both rivers, the
aggregate population being more than a half-million.
Numerous bridges span the rivers, the narrow shores
between the steep hills bearing a mixed maze of railways
and factories. Countless chimney-smokes and
steam-jets come up in all directions, overhanging the
town like a pall; and so impressive is the obscuration,
combined with the lurid glare of furnaces and the
weird white gleam of electric lights, that the elevated
view down into Pittsburg seems a veritable pandemonium.
So startling is it on a lowering day that it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
has been pointedly described by one who thus for the
first time looked upon the "Smoky City," far down
in its deep basin among the high hills, as appearing
like "Hell with the lid off." There are plenty of
railways in the scene, and scores of odd-looking,
stumpy-prowed little steamboats built high above the
water, having huge stern-wheels to drive them, with
their noses thrust up on the sloping levee along the
river bank, whereon is piled the cargoes, chiefly of
iron products. The swift current turns all the sterns
down stream, so that they lie diagonally towards the
shore. Fleets of flat, shallow coal barges are moored
along, waiting to be made up into tows for their
journey down the Ohio, as Pittsburg has an extensive
river trade, covering over twenty thousand miles
of Western waters. Out of the weird and animated
scene there come all sorts of busy noises, forges and
trip-hammers pounding, steam hissing, railroad trains
running, whistles screeching, locomotives puffing,
bells ringing, so that with the flame jets rising, and
the smokes of all colors blowing about, there is got a
good idea of the active industries of this very busy
place.</p>

<p class="center p2">PITTSBURG DEVELOPMENT.</p>

<p>This wonderful industrial development all came
within the nineteenth century. There is still preserved
as a relic of its origin the little block-house
citadel of the old Fort Pitt, down near the
point of the peninsula where the rivers join. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
has recently been restored by the Daughters of the
American Revolution&mdash;a small square building with
a pyramidal roof. The surrounding stockade long
ago disappeared. There is in the Pittsburg City
Hall an inscribed tablet from Fort Pitt bearing the
date 1764. The old building, which was the scene
of Pittsburg's earliest history, for it stands almost on
the spot occupied by Fort Duquesne, is among
modern mills and storehouses, about three hundred
feet from the head of the Ohio. Pittsburg, after an
almost exclusive devotion to manufacturing and business,
began some years ago to cultivate artistic tastes
in architecture, and has some very fine buildings.
There is an elaborate Post-office and an interesting
City Hall on Smithfield Street; but the finest building
of all, and one of the best in the country, is the magnificent
Romanesque Court-house, built at a cost of
$2,500,000, and occupying a prominent position on
a hill adjoining Fifth Avenue. There is a massive
jail of similar architecture, and a "Bridge of
Sighs" connects them, a beautifully designed arched
and stone-covered bridge, thrown for a passageway
across an intervening street. The main tower,
giving a grand view, rises three hundred and twenty
feet over the architectural pile, and, as in Venice, the
convicted prisoner crosses the bridge from his trial
to his doom. There are attractive churches, banks
and business buildings, and eastward from the city,
near Schenley Park, is the attractive Carnegie Library
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
and Museum in Italian Renaissance, with a
capacity for two hundred thousand volumes, a benefaction
of Mr. Andrew Carnegie, originally costing
$1,100,000, to which he has recently added $1,750,000
for its enlargement. The residential section is
mainly on the hills east of Pittsburg and across the
Allegheny River in Allegheny City, there being
many attractive villas in beautiful situations on the
surrounding highlands.</p>

<p>But the great Pittsburg attraction is the multitude
of factories that are its pride and create its prosperity.
Some of these are among the greatest in the
world&mdash;the Edgar Thomson Works and Homestead
Works of the Carnegie Steel Company, the Duquesne
Steel Works, the Keystone Bridge Company, and
others. The Edgar Thomas mills make over a million
tons of rails a year, and at Homestead fifteen
hundred thousand tons of steel will be annually produced,
this being the place where nickel-steel armor-plates
for the navy are manufactured. They largely
use natural gas, and employ at times ten thousand
men at the two great establishments. The Duquesne
Works, just above Homestead on the Monongahela,
have the four largest blast furnaces in the world,
producing twenty-two hundred tons of pig-iron daily.
The Keystone Bridge Works cover seven acres, and
have made some of the greatest steel bridges in existence.
The Westinghouse Electrical Works manufacture
the greatest dynamos, including those of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
Niagara Power Company, and the Westinghouse Air-Brake
Works is also another extensive establishment.
In the Pittsburg district, covering about two hundred
square miles, the daily product of mines and factories
is estimated at $6,000,000.</p>

<p>The two men whose names are most closely connected
with Pittsburg's vast industrial development
are Andrew Carnegie and George Westinghouse.
Carnegie was born at Dunfermline, Scotland, in
1837, and his father, a potter, brought him to Pittsburg
when eleven years old. He began life as a telegraph
messenger boy, attracted the attention of
Colonel Thomas A. Scott, and was by him brought
into the service of the Pennsylvania Railroad. Then
he entered business, and became the greatest developer
of the iron and steel industries of Pittsburg
and its wealthiest resident. He some time ago sold out
his interests to the Carnegie Steel Company, in which
he is largely interested. Westinghouse, born in New
York State in 1846, combined with business tact the
genius of the inventor. He invented and developed
the railway air-brake now in universal use, has established
a complete electrical lighting and power system,
and was the chief adapter of natural gas to
manufacturing and domestic uses, being the inventor
of many ingenious contrivances for its introduction
and economical employment. He had a gas well
almost at his door, for Pittsburg overlaid a great deposit.
The enormous coal measures underlying and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
surrounding the city have been its most stable basis
for industry and profit, as the Pittsburg coal-field is
one of enormous output. The deposits of Lake Superior
furnish the ores for its furnaces, and the railroad
development is such that each enormous establishment
now has its special railroad to fetch in the ores
from Lake Erie, where they are brought by vessels.
Across in Allegheny City, where most of these ore-bringing
roads go out, about one hundred acres in
the centre of the city are reserved for the attractive
Allegheny Park, one portion rising in a very
steep hill, almost at the edge of the Allegheny River.
Upon its top, seen from afar, stands a Soldiers' Monument,
a graceful column, erected in memory of four
thousand men of Allegheny County who fell in the
Civil War. Soldier statues guard the base, and look
out upon the smokes and steam jets of the busy city
below, and thousands climb up there to enjoy the
grand view.</p>

<p class="center p2">COAL, COKE AND GAS.</p>

<p>The four counties adjoining Pittsburg turn out
over thirty millions of tons of bituminous coal in a
year. To carry this coal away, besides railways, the
city has about a million and a half of tonnage of river
craft of various kinds, a greater tonnage than all the
Mississippi River ports put together. Its coal boats
go everywhere throughout the Western water ways,
and two thousand miles down the Ohio and Mississippi
to New Orleans. Its stumpy but powerful little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
tugs, with their stern-wheels, will safely convey fleets
of shallow flatboats, sometimes over twenty thousand
tons of coal being carried in a single tow. These flatboats
are collected in the rivers about Pittsburg,
waiting for the proper stage of water on the Ohio;
and to regulate the depth at the city the curious
movable dam was constructed at Davis's Island, four
miles below Pittsburg, at a cost of $1,000,000, the
dam opening when necessary to let freshets through,
and having a lock five hundred feet long and one
hundred and ten feet wide to pass the boats. The
Monongahela River above Pittsburg has for miles a
series of coal mines in the high bordering banks, the
river being lined with coal "tipples," which load the
flatboats; and it is also provided with a series of
dams, which aid navigation and divide the channel
into a succession of "pools." The very crooked
Youghiogheny flows in at McKeesport, fifteen miles
above Pittsburg, another river of coal mines, whose
name was given as a signification of its crookedness by
the matter-of-fact Indians, the word signifying "the
stream flowing a contrary, roundabout course." This
river comes northward out of the chief coke district of
America, in the flanks of the long Chestnut Ridge, the
Connellsville coke region sometimes turning out ten
millions of tons annually from its ovens. Railways
run in there on both river banks to Connellsville, a
town of six thousand people, in the midst of the coke
ovens, and about fifty-six miles south of Pittsburg.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span></p>

<p>Pittsburg is decreasing its use of natural gas for
manufacturing, as the diminishing supply and greater
distance it has to be brought are making it too costly
for the iron and glass works, which are returning
again to coal and coke, but the city is still said to use
forty-five thousand millions of cubic feet in a year,
mostly for domestic purposes. Pittsburg stands in a
great but partly exhausted natural-gas district. The
gas is stored under pressure beneath strata of rock,
being set free when these are pierced. This is a
gaseous member of the paraffin series, of which
petroleum is a liquid member, and is mainly marsh-gas,
the "fire-damp" of the miner. It originates in
the decomposition of animal and vegetable life, and
usually has but little odor, whilst its illuminating
power is low, but in fuel value eight cubic feet equal
one pound of coal. It was first used at Fredonia,
New York, in 1821, for lighting purposes, being procured
from a well. The natural-gas region is the part
of Pennsylvania west of the Alleghenies, extending
into New York, Ohio and West Virginia; and gas is
also found in Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky and Kansas.
It is held under enormous pressure within the
pockets beneath the rocks, and when first reached in
drilling, the tension has been known to equal a thousand
pounds per square inch. It is not uncommon,
when a well is drilled, to have all the tools and casing-pipe
blown out, while an enormous thickness of
masonry has to be constructed to hold down the cap
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
that covers the well. Its use began in Pittsburg in
1886, the chief field of supply then being Murrysville,
about twenty miles east of the city, while there
are also other fields southwest and east of Pittsburg.
The pipes underlie all the streets, and a main route
of supply is along the bed of the Allegheny River.
There are said to be about sixteen hundred miles of
pipes laid down to lead the gas to Pittsburg from
the different fields.</p>

<p class="center p2">PETROLEUM.</p>

<p>The great petroleum fields lie in and near the
Pittsburg region, in the basin of the Allegheny and
Ohio Rivers, and extend from New York southwest
to West Virginia, and also into Ohio. This region
has had enormous yields in different parts of the
river basin, the wells, however, ultimately dwindling
as their supplies are drawn out. The petroleum industry,
which has been one of the greatest in Pennsylvania,
has been gradually all absorbed by the
Standard Oil Company, which is probably the most
extensive industrial combination in America, and certainly
the most powerful. Yet we are told that
those financial magnates began their wonderful
career with an aggregate capital of only $24,000,
largely borrowed money. There have been forty
millions of barrels of petroleum taken from this great
basin in a single year. The oil wells are bored in
many places, south, southwest, north and northeast
of Pittsburg. The "Panhandle Railroad," which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
crosses West Virginia to the Ohio, exhibits many of
them. A branch of this railroad goes to Canonsburg,
and thence to the town of Washington, on the
old "National Road," thirty miles from Pittsburg.
At Canonsburg was founded in 1773 Jefferson College,
in a log cabin, which has now become the Jefferson
Theological Seminary of the Presbyterian
Church. Washington is a town of about four thousand
people, rambling over a pleasant hilly region in
Southwestern Pennsylvania, having as its chief institution
Washington and Jefferson College, also a
Presbyterian foundation, started in 1806 in what
was then a remote Scotch-Irish colony beyond the
mountains. Near this town in 1888 were struck the
greatest petroleum wells the world ever knew. One
of them, the Jumbo well, in sixty days after the first
strike had poured out one hundred and forty thousand
barrels of oil, flowing a steady circular stream
of almost white oil, about five inches in diameter, at
the rate of forty-two hundred gallons an hour. Another
well, afterwards bored not far away, in its
freshness of infancy poured out sixty-three hundred
gallons an hour. Additional wells were bored with
almost the same results; but they all afterwards
dwindled, and finally ceasing a free flow, had to be
pumped. This is the universal experience of all the
oil regions, the "gushers," soon after the great
strikes, giving out, as the store of petroleum in the
reservoirs beneath becomes exhausted. But all this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
shows how enormous is the natural wealth of the
Pittsburg district&mdash;oil, coal, coke and gas, with iron,
steel and glass, electricity and railways, contributing
to the wonderful prosperity.</p>

<p>The greatest petroleum field, however, was up the
Allegheny River, in Northwestern Pennsylvania, and
the first wells bored to obtain it were sunk at Titusville,
on Oil Creek, in 1859. The early settlers
knew of the appearance of oil about the headwaters
of the Allegheny in New York and Pennsylvania,
and the name of Oil Creek was given a stream for
this reason in Allegheny County, New York, and also
to the one in Venango County, Pennsylvania. The
Indians had long collected the oil on the shores of
Seneca Lake in New York, a course that the white
settlers followed, and it was for years sold as a medicine
by the name of Seneca or Genesee oil. When
its commercial value for illuminating purposes began
to be recognized, Colonel E. L. Drake went to Titusville
to see if it could be obtained in sufficient quantities.
He bored the first well about a mile south of
Titusville, and on August 26, 1859, the oil was
struck at a depth of seventy-one feet. The drill
suddenly sunk into the cavity of the rock beneath,
and the oil rose within a few inches of the surface.
A small pump was introduced which brought out four
hundred gallons daily, and then a large pump, increasing
the daily flow to a thousand gallons. Soon
a steam-engine was applied, and the flow continued
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
uninterrupted for weeks. Titusville had at the time
three hundred people. Many wells were sunk in the
neighborhood with varying success, and the product
of the Oil Creek district became so large that the
market could not absorb it, and at the beginning of
1861, with two thousand wells in operation, the price
declined to twenty-five cents per barrel. The two
great wells were the Empire, originally yielding
twenty-five hundred barrels daily, and the Phillips,
nearly four thousand barrels. In 1863 the production
had slackened, but the uses had expanded, and
prices rose proportionately. Vast fortunes were then
rapidly made, and as soon squandered. In the first
twelve years of the development of this district,
which extended over about four hundred square
miles, there were taken from some four thousand
wells forty-two millions of barrels of oil, which were
marketed for $163,000,000. At first it was carried
away by the railroads, of which several sent branches
into the district, but there have since been laid extensive
lines of pipes which convey it in various directions,
and largely to New York and Philadelphia
for foreign export. When this district was at the
height of its yield it produced four hundred millions
of gallons a year.</p>

<p class="center p2">ASCENDING THE ALLEGHENY.</p>

<p>From Pittsburg, through bold and pleasing scenery,
we ascend the Allegheny River, the broad channel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
flowing grandly around stately bends enclosed between
high hills. Thirty miles above Pittsburg the
Kiskiminetas comes in, and in a region of coal
mines and furnaces is found the town of Kittanning,
which retains the name of the Indian village standing
there in Colonial days. This original Indian village
was attacked by Colonel Armstrong and three hundred
troops at dawn on August 8, 1757, and the Indians,
who sided with the French, refusing to surrender,
they were pretty much all killed and their
village burnt. Armstrong's name is preserved in the
county. Beyond is Brady's Bend, a great curve of
the river, and here are seen the derricks of many deserted
oil wells, as the farther journey above for
miles also discloses. This was the Modoc oil district.
The Morrison well was struck in 1872, yielding five
hundred barrels daily, and immediately a town was
laid out, not inappropriately called Greece City, and
it soon had a large population. This was a prolific
oil region at one time, and back from the river were
the well-known oleaginous towns of Modoc City,
Karns City and Petrolia. The Allegheny River
gradually leads us up to Venango County, which was
the chief oil region. Franklin, the capital of the
county, has about five thousand inhabitants, and is
built at the mouth of French Creek, the site of the
old French Fort Venango, which Indian word meant
"a guiding mark on a tree." It stood on a commanding
ridge, and was one of the chain of posts the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
French built from the lakes across to the Ohio, to
hold their possessions, dating from 1753. The French
had a large garrison there, but after Canada was captured
the English got possession, and in 1763 it was
the scene of a terrible massacre, the Indians taking
it, murdering the entire garrison, and slowly roasting
the commandant to death.</p>

<p>Five miles above, Oil Creek flows into the Allegheny,
and here is Oil City, the petroleum headquarters.
It has had a varying history, being once
almost destroyed by flood and twice by fire, but
maintains its supremacy and is a complete oil town&mdash;the
air filled with petroleum odors, and the lower
streets saturated with the fluid. On the Allegheny,
nine miles from Oil City, is Oleopolis, and a short
distance inland is Pithole City, which was one of the
famous oil towns whose rise and decline were so phenomenal.
A few farmers here tried to get a scanty
subsistence from the rocky and almost barren soil,
where, on a hill, there was a fissure two to four feet
wide, called the "pithole," from which came out at
intervals hot air and bad smells. This was on the
Holmden farm, which had been nominally valued at
five dollars an acre. Somebody thought he detected
the smell of oil among the odors coming up, and a
well was bored. It struck oil in the winter of 1864-65,
and was the greatest strike made down to that
time&mdash;the United States Well yielding seven thousand
barrels daily. Multitudes flocked thither, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
in six months Pithole City arose in the wilderness
with fifteen thousand inhabitants, two theatres, an
opera house, a daily newspaper, and seventy-two
hotels of various degrees. Numerous wells were
sunk, and the oil sold at $5 to $8 per barrel, being
readily sent to the seaboard. The Holmden farm
was soon sold for $4,000,000. There were some
amazing speculative trades made. The story is told
of a well striking oil and a speculative bystander at
once buying a three-fourths interest in it for $18,000,
agreeing to pay the money next day. Turning away
from the seller, he met a man seeking such an investment,
and promptly resold his interest for $75,000,
receiving immediate payment. The yield of this region
was so prolific that railroads and pipe lines were
soon constructed to carry the oil away. Pithole had
its great boom in the autumn of 1866, wells being
bored in every direction, and real estate fetching
enormous prices. One old fellow who had a few
acres of arid land in the centre of the excitement sold
his farm and hovel for $800,000, paid him on the spot
in $1000 notes; and then he sorrowfully bemoaned,
as he took a last look at the hovel he had occupied
all his life, "Now I haint got any home." The rise
of this wonderful town was rapid, and its downfall
came all too soon. The oil supply became exhausted,
the speculators left, the inhabitants dwindled in number,
and by 1870 Pithole had reverted almost to its
original condition. The chief hotel, which had cost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
$31,000 to build, was afterwards sold for $100, and
the population had declined in 1873 to nine families.</p>

<p>The valley of Oil Creek is filled with derricks and
oil tanks, having a few pumping engines at work, but
most of the derricks are over abandoned wells. Eighteen
miles up Oil Creek is Titusville, and when the
oil yield was at its height, about 1865, this valley
had a population of seventy-five thousand people.
Titusville is pleasantly built in the broadened intervale,
surrounded by hills, the streets being wide and
straight, and the residences comfortable, each in its
garden enclosure. There are oil refineries, and iron
works which make engines, tubing and other supplies;
and the town, which has eight thousand people,
is a headquarters for the Standard Oil Company.
Twenty-seven miles farther northward is Corry, a
prominent railroad centre, at the northern entrance
to the Pennsylvania "Oil Dorado," as the region has
been popularly called. Its name of Corry was that
of the farmer who originally cultivated the soil when
the place became a railway station in 1861, and the
location of oil refineries then began its prosperity.
There are now about six thousand inhabitants. It is
within a short distance of the New York State boundary,
and marks the northern limit of the Pennsylvania
oil region. This whole district, once the prominent
petroleum field of Pennsylvania, has been
eclipsed, however, by other and more prolific oil
basins. Fortunes were made here, but most of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
wealth passed away; and the history of the Pennsylvania
petroleum trade and its vicissitudes, with the
absorption of everything of value by the Standard
Oil Company, has emphasized the truth so pointedly
told by Robert Burns, that "The best laid schemes
o' mice an' men gang aft a-gley." Its wonderful
tide of prosperity and its subsequent ebb recall Shelley's
lines "To Men of England":</p>

<p class="center p2">CAROLINA.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Raleigh, of chivalrous memory, sent
the first English colony to America in the sixteenth
century. He was a half-brother of Sir Humphrey
Gilbert, the English explorer, and had previously accompanied
Gilbert to Newfoundland. He sent out
an expedition in 1584, which selected Roanoke
Island, south of the Chesapeake, for a settlement,
and for this enterprise Queen Elizabeth knighted
Raleigh, gave him a grant of the whole country, and
directed that the new land be named in her honor,
Virginia. In 1585-86 colonizing expeditions were
sent to Roanoke, but they did not prosper. The
colonists quarrelled with the Indians, and in the latter
year the Governor returned to England for provisions
and reinforcements, leaving behind with the colony
his daughter, Mrs. Dare, and a granddaughter, nine
days old, Virginia Dare, the first English child born
in the new land. Then came the Spanish Armada to
conquer England, and the long war with Spain. Nobody
went to succor the little band of exiles on Roanoke
Island for three years, and when they did, the settlement
was obliterated, the hundred colonists and
little Virginia Dare had disappeared, and no tidings
of them were ever obtained. Thus perished Raleigh's
colony; and, his means being exhausted, he was discouraged
and sent no more expeditions out to
America. His enterprise failed in making a permanent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
settlement, but it gave two priceless gifts to
Europe. The returning Governor took back to England
the potato, which Raleigh planted on his Irish
estate and which has proved the salvation of old
Erin, and also the Virginia tobacco, which he taught
the people to smoke, and the fragrant weed became
the solace of the world.</p>

<p>No further attempts at colonization were made
until the seventeenth century, when new grants were
issued, and the country was named Carolina in honor
of King Charles I. The Atlantic Coast south of the
Chesapeake Bay entrance is low and bordered by
sand beaches, which for most of the distance in front
of North Carolina are far eastward of the mainland,
with broad sounds and river estuaries between.
These long and narrow beaches protrude in some
cases a hundred miles into the ocean and form dangerous
shoals, the extensive Albemarle and Pamlico
Sounds being enclosed by them, the former stretching
fifty miles and the latter seventy-five miles into
the land. Out in front of Pamlico Sound projects
the shoulder of Cape Hatteras into the Atlantic, the
outer point of a low, sandy island, with shoals extending
far beyond it, and marked by the great
beacon of this dangerous coast, a flashing light one
hundred and ninety feet high. Here is the principal
storm factory of the southern coast, noted for cyclonic
disturbances and dreaded by the mariner. Upon the
outer Diamond Shoals the Government has long tried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
in vain to erect a lighthouse. A lightship is kept
there, but is frequently blown from her moorings and
drifts ashore. The Gulf Stream, coming with warm
and speedy current up from Florida, is here diverged
out into the ocean by the shoulder of Hatteras; and,
similarly, the whirling West India cyclones of enormous
area come along with their resistless energy,
destroying everything in their paths. In the terrific
hurricane of the autumn of 1899 a wind velocity of
one hundred and sixty miles an hour was reached
momentarily, and the anemometer at Hatteras was
blown down after having recorded a velocity of one
hundred and twenty miles. The actual force exerted
by one of these great cyclones in its work of devastation,
which uproots trees, demolishes buildings and
strews the coast with wrecks, has been calculated as
equalling one thousand million horse-power.</p>

<p class="center p2">WILMINGTON AND FORT FISHER.</p>

<p>The interior of North Carolina adjoining the Sounds
is largely swamp land, and the broad belt of forest,
chiefly pines, which parallels the coast all along the
Atlantic seaboard. Through this region the railway
extends southward from Virginia past Weldon to
Wilmington, an uninteresting route among the
swamps and pine lands, showing sparse settlement
and poor agriculture, the wood paths exhibiting an
occasional ox-team or a stray horseman going home
with his supplies from the cross-roads store, a typical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
representative of the "tar-heels of Carolina." The
railway crosses the deep valley of Roanoke River,
and then over the Tar and Neuse Rivers, traversing
the extensive district that provides the world's greatest
supply of naval stores&mdash;the tar, pitch, turpentine,
rosin and timber that are so largely shipped out of
the Cape Fear River from Wilmington. This is the
chief city of North Carolina, having about twenty
thousand people, and is located on the Cape Fear
River twenty-six miles from its mouth. The city
spreads along the eastern shore upon the peninsula
between it and the ocean. The first settlement antedates
the Revolution, when the inhabitants, who were
sturdy patriots, drove out the royal Governor and
made Fort Johnson, at the mouth of the river, an
American stronghold. Upon the secession of the
Carolinas in 1860-61 this fort was occupied by the
Confederates and replaced by the larger work on
Federal Point, between the river and the sea, known
as Fort Fisher. Owing to the peculiar location and
ease of entrance, the Cape Fear River became famous
in the Civil War as a haven for blockade-runners,
the effective defense made by Fort Fisher fully protecting
this traffic. As the Union blockade of the
Southern harbors became more completely effective
with the progress of the war, this finally was about
the only port that could be entered, and an enormous
traffic was kept up between Wilmington and Nassau,
on the British island of New Providence, in the Bahamas,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
not far away, some three hundred fleet foreign
steamships safely running the blockade into
Cape Fear River during 1863 and 1864. The notoriety
of this traffic, from which enormous profits
were made, became world-wide, and it was decided
late in 1864 that Fort Fisher had to be captured, in
order to make the Southern blockade entirely effective.
A joint land and naval attack was made by
General Butler and Admiral Porter in December,
1864, but they were obliged to retire without seriously
damaging the fort. Then General Butler ineffectively
attempted to blow up the fort by exploding
a powder-boat near it. Finally a new expedition
was landed in January, 1865, under General Terry,
and in coöperation with the navy, which made a fierce
bombardment, they captured the fort on the 15th,
after severe loss, the works being partially destroyed
the following day by the accidental explosion of the
powder magazine. This capture ended the blockade-running
at Wilmington, and had much to do with
precipitating the fall of Richmond in the following
April.</p>

<p class="center p2">CHARLESTON AND FORT SUMTER.</p>

<p>The railway from Wilmington to the South at first
goes westward through a region largely composed of
swamps, and then entering South Carolina turns
southward past Florence to Charleston. The country
is a variation of pine barrens and morass, sparsely
inhabited, but raising much cotton, with many bales
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
brought to the stations for shipment. There is a
much larger population of blacks than of whites.
Charleston, the metropolis of South Carolina, is an
active seaport with sixty-five thousand inhabitants,
having a good export trade in cotton, timber, naval
stores, rice, fruits and phosphate rock, of which there
are extensive deposits on Ashley River nearby. It
is a low-lying city, built upon a peninsula between
the Ashley and Cooper Rivers, just inland from the
ocean, and having a good harbor. Its many wooden
houses are varied by more pretentious ones of brick
and stone, but there is an air of decadence produced
by the traces still remaining of the earthquake of
1886, which destroyed the greater part of the buildings
and killed many people. The dwelling architecture
of Charleston presents the tropical features
of open verandas, spacious porticos and broad windows
looking out upon gardens in which the palmetto
tree grows, typical of South Carolina, the "Palmetto
State." At the point of the peninsula between the
rivers is the Battery, a park and popular promenade
overlooking the harbor, with Fort Sumter down on its
little shoal-like island, seen as a small dark streak
upon the distant horizon. The first settlements in
this part of South Carolina were made on the west
bank of Ashley River, but the town, which had been
named in honor of King Charles II., in 1680 was
transferred to its present site. Charleston was prominent
in the Revolution, its troops under Colonel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
Moultrie repelling a British attack upon Sullivan's
Island in 1776; but the city was captured by Sir
Henry Clinton in 1780 after an obstinate defense.
Before the Civil War it was the chief cotton-shipping
port of America, though it is now surpassed by
the Gulf ports and by Savannah. The great memory
in the city of that time of its greatest prosperity is
of the apostle of "State Rights," the South Carolina
statesman, John C. Calhoun, who died in 1850. His
statue stands in Citadel Square, and his grave is in
St. Philip's churchyard.</p>

<p>The broad estuary of Charleston harbor is completely
landlocked, and has an entrance from the sea
about a mile wide. On the southern side is Fort
Moultrie, which was enlarged from the battery that
repulsed the British attack in 1776, on Sullivan's
Island, this now being a favorite summer resort, and
dotted with wooden cottages facing the sea. Just
behind the fort is the grave of Osceola, the famous
chief of the Seminoles, who long carried on war in
the Florida everglades, but was captured and brought
a prisoner to Fort Moultrie, dying in 1838. Fort
Sumter, three miles below Charleston, stands upon a
shoal of about three acres, out in mid-channel, which
is protected from the water encroachment by stone
rip-rapping. It was faced with brick during the
Civil War, but the work has since been modernized.
At the opening of the war, Major Anderson occupied
this fort with the small force of seventy-five men,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
which, after the secession of South Carolina from the
Union, December 20, 1860, had been transferred
thither from Fort Moultrie, the State troops immediately
seizing Moultrie and all the other forts around
the harbor, and the Federal public buildings in
Charleston. They also constructed new batteries on
Morris Island, the nearest land to Fort Sumter. On
January 9, 1861, the Government at Washington
sent the steamer "Star of the West" into the harbor
with provisions and a reinforcement of two hundred
and fifty troops. The first shot of the Civil War was
on that day fired at her from Morris Island, and the
ship being struck by this and subsequent shots, her
commander abandoned the project and withdrew.
There was a good deal of negotiation and delay afterwards,
the Government, on April 8th, finally determining
to provision Fort Sumter, as Anderson's
supplies would be exhausted on the 15th, and so informing
the Governor of South Carolina. On the
11th, General Beauregard, commanding the State
forces, demanded the surrender of the fort, which was
refused. Major Anderson was notified early next
morning that the fort would be fired upon in one
hour, and cannonading began at 4.20 <span class="s08">A.M.</span> on the 12th.
A fleet of vessels appeared off the harbor at noon with
provisions, exchanged signals with the fort, but made
no attempt to land, and on the 13th terms of surrender
were arranged by which Major Anderson and his
little command marched out on the 14th with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
honors of war, saluting the American flag with fifty
guns. This bombardment and evacuation set the
North in a blaze of patriotic excitement and began
the Civil War.</p>

<p>The naval forces of the United States attacked
Fort Sumter in April, 1863, but were repulsed, the
monitor "Keokuk" being so seriously injured that
she afterwards sunk. Subsequently, the Union troops
landed on Morris Island, erected batteries, and in
August partly destroyed the works at Sumter; and
its bombardment, and also that of Charleston, continued
with but brief intermission till the war closed
in 1865. On Morris Island was set up the original
"long-range gun," General Gillmore's "Swamp
Angel" now adorning a drinking-fountain at Trenton,
New Jersey; and its ability, until it unfortunately
burst, to shoot its bolts into Charleston, then
regarded as an almost impossible distance to carry a
projectile, attracted the attention of gunnery experts
throughout the world. Its conspicuous mark was the
white spire of St. Michael's Church up in the beleaguered
city. This famous old church, dating from
1752, was struck six times during these attacks and
seriously damaged. It was also partly demolished
by a cyclone in 1885, and nearly destroyed by the
earthquake of 1886; but it has been since restored,
and its prominent steeple commands a good view.
Charleston, however, seems to have always been used
to this sort of thing. Its statue of William Pitt in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
front of the City Hall had the right arm broken off by
a British cannon-shot in 1780. But if the city is thus
somewhat in dilapidation, its grand development of
foliage and flowers gives a compensation. Everywhere
in the suburbs and in the streets and gardens are seen
magnificent azaleas, magnolias, camellias, and the famous
live oak, which flourish in luxuriance and add to
the charms of this restful South Carolina metropolis.</p>

<p class="center p2">THE CITY OF SAVANNAH.</p>

<p>The seacoast of South Carolina and Georgia is
composed largely of deeply indented bays, with
many islands, tortuous bayous, and a labyrinth of
water ways bordered by dense vegetation. Southward
from Charleston harbor to the Savannah River
many creeks provide a system of inland navigation
and form fertile islands. There are two capacious
Sounds, St. Helena and Port Royal, the latter being
one of the finest harbors in the world, and the rendezvous
of the American North Atlantic naval
squadron when in these waters. This was the place
of first landing of the original South Carolina colonists
before they went to the Ashley River, and its
chief town now is Beaufort, on St. Helena Island.
These coast islands raise the famous "sea-island
cotton," and the whole lowland region produces prolific
crops of rice. The adjacent land is generally
swampy, and its chief industry, outside of cultivating
the fields, is the working of the extensive phosphate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
deposits, which are manufactured into fertilizers.
The railway, largely constructed on piles,
passes through much marsh and morass, crosses
swift-running dirty streams, and over the swamps
and among the pine timber, varied by the oak, bay
tree and laurel, which the humid atmosphere has
hung with garlands of sombre gray moss and clusters
of ivy and other creeping plants. The festooned
moss, overrunning and often destroying the foliage
of the trees, gives the scene a weird and ghostly appearance.
The railway route is bordered by an apparently
almost impenetrable jungle, the few settlements
are widely separated, and population is sparse,
seeming to be chiefly negroes dressed in ancient-looking
clothing ornamented with patches. The few
whites who appear are bilious and yellowish, their
complexions and garb being alike of the butternut
hue, while both races seem to talk the same dialect.
Thus moving farther southward, the Carolina "tar-heels"
are replaced by the "crackers" and "butternuts,"
looking as if they had been rolled for a generation
in the clayey soils drained by the Edisto,
Coosawhatchie and Savannah Rivers and their neighboring
streams, and who, farther inland, are the
"clay-eaters" of Georgia. Then crossing the Savannah
River, the route is upon the level lowlands
down its Georgia bank, and into the city of Savannah,
arriving amid a vast collection of rosin and pitch
barrels, cotton bales and timber.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span></p>

<p>Savannah&mdash;derived from the Spanish word <i>sabana</i>,
a "meadow or plain"&mdash;is known popularly as the
"Forest City," and is built upon a bluff along the
river shore, eighteen miles from the sea. It has
fifty thousand people and a large export trade in
naval stores, rice, timber and cotton, in the latter export
being second only to New Orleans. It received
great impetus after the Civil War, owing to its excellent
railway connections with the interior, and is
now the chief port of the Southern Atlantic coast.
The city extends upon a level sandy plain, stretching
back from the bluff shore along the river, has
broad streets crossing at right angles, with small
parks at the intersections, and many trees border
the streets and fill the parks, so that it is fairly
embowered in foliage, thus presenting an attractive
and novel appearance. This adornment makes Savannah
the most beautiful city of the coast&mdash;the oak,
palmetto and magnolia, with the holly, orange, creeping
ivy and clustering vines, setting the buildings in
a framework of delicious green. The business quarter
is along the bluff, where the ships moor alongside
the storehouses, which have their upper stories on a
level with the busy Bay Street at its top. Much of
the present beauty of the city is due to the foresight
of its founder who laid out the plan&mdash;General Oglethorpe,
who selected this place in 1733 for the capital
of his Province of Georgia, the youngest of the
original thirteen colonies.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span></p>

<p>General James Edward Oglethorpe was a native
of London and an officer in the British army, who,
being of philanthropic tendencies, obtained a grant
of the Province from King George for the purpose
of providing an asylum for the poor debtors of England
and a home for the Protestants of all nations.
After founding the city and receiving a colony of
Protestants from Salzburg, he visited England and
brought out John and Charles Wesley in 1735, and
got George Whitefield to come and preach to the
colonists in 1737. War breaking out with Spain, he
attacked Florida, carrying his invasion to the gates
of St. Augustine, but was repulsed. He returned to
England in 1743, but though he lived until 1785 as
a retired general upon half-pay, he never revisited
America. The British captured Savannah in the
Revolution, and repulsed a combined French and
American attempt to recapture it in 1779. In this
attack Count Pulaski fell, and the spot, now Monterey
Square, near the centre of the city, is marked by
the Pulaski Monument, one of the noblest shafts in
America. Count Pulaski is the patron saint of Savannah,
and Fort Pulaski, named in his honor, guards
the Savannah River entrance from the sea. During
the Civil War, however, this fort was practically useless,
as it was captured by the Unionists in 1862,
and Tybee Roads, the harbor at the entrance, was
hermetically sealed throughout the war by the blockading
fleet. General Sherman's triumphant march
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
through Georgia ended in December, 1864, at Savannah,
and his headquarters are still pointed out,
opposite Madison Square. Savannah has a fine
pleasure-ground in Forsyth Park, with its wealth of
trees and ornamental shrubbery, and the adjoining
Parade Ground containing the Confederate Soldiers'
Monument. The favorite route to the southern suburbs
is the famous Thunderbolt Shell Road leading to
Thunderbolt River, and noted for its avenues of live
oaks draped with Spanish moss. Here is also the
favorite burial-place, the Bonaventure Cemetery,
where the graves and tombstones are laid out alongside
passages embowered by live oaks, their wide-stretching,
gaunt and angular limbs being richly garlanded
with the gray moss and encircled by creeping
ivy. The long vista views under these sombre archways
have an elfish look, peculiarly appropriate for a
city of the dead, and it would take little imagination
to conjure up the spirits of the departed and see them
wandering beneath these canopies of shrouds.</p>

<p class="center p2">THE CITY OF JACKSONVILLE.</p>

<p>Southward from Savannah, the railway route to
Florida renews the monotonous landscape of woods
and swamps. For ninety miles it goes in an almost
straight line southwest through the pine belt of
Southern Georgia, crossing the Ogeechee and Altamaha
Rivers to Waycross, and then, turning to the
southeast, proceeds in another almost straight line
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
for about an equal distance towards the coast, and
crosses St. Mary's River into Florida. It traverses
the edge of the noted Okifenokee Swamp of Georgia,
the Indian "weaving, shaking, water," a moist and
mushy region of mystery and legend, drained by the
poetic Suwanee, the Indian "Echo river," which has
been made the theme of a favorite melody. This
stream flows through Florida into the Gulf of Mexico,
while on the eastern side the extensive swamp overflows
into the winding St. Mary's River leading to
the Atlantic. To the southward, the pine woods of
Florida grow out of a sandy soil nearly as level as a
floor, in which almost every depression and fissure
seems filled with water, and the balsamic odors of
these pines, combined with the mildness of the winter
climate, give an indication of the attractions which
make Florida so popular as a resort for the Northern
people. The route finally reaches the broad St.
John's River at the Florida metropolis, Jacksonville,
a Yankee city in the South, bearing the name of the
famous President, General Andrew Jackson, and
having thirty thousand population, largely of Northern
birth. This is the centre of the railway system
of Florida and of most of the business of the State,
having a large export trade in timber, naval stores,
phosphates, oranges and other Florida products. To
the visitor, probably the first most forcible impression
is made by the free growth of oranges along
the streets and in the house gardens. The city
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
stands upon the northern and outer bank of a magnificent
bend of St. John's River, this noble stream,
which flows northward from Southern Florida, being
a mile wide, and sweeping around to the eastward at
Jacksonville to reach the sea about twenty-five miles
beyond, its navigation having been improved by
dredging and constructing jetties to maintain a channel
through the bar at the mouth. The business section
is near the shore, and the railways come down
to the wharves; while, as the curving river stretches
away to the southward, the bank is lined with rows
of fine suburban villas, occupied by the business men
who have built their comfortable homes amid the
oranges, oleanders, magnolias and banana trees. The
river has low tree-clad shores, and far over on the
opposite bank are more villas and orange groves.</p>

<p>Jacksonville is well supplied with hotels and lodging-houses,
which accommodate the crowds of winter
visitors from the North, and it spreads into various
suburban villages reached by steamboats and hard
shell roads. It is the great <i>entrepôt</i> for Florida,
standing at the northern verge, the salubrious and
equable climate being the attraction, for frost is rare,
and the winters are usually clear and dry and give a
most magnificent atmosphere. Rows of splendid
oaks line the streets, and form fine archways of
green, giving a delicious shade. Besides the orange,
the alligator is also a Jacksonville attraction, live
ones being kept as pets, little ones sent northward in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
boxes for gifts, and dead ones of all sizes prepared
for ornaments. This reptile is the type and emblem
of Florida; his skin and teeth are worked into fantastic
shapes, and his curious bones and formation do
duty in the make-up of many "Florida curiosities."
In fact, outside of the timber, which is most prolific,
the best known Florida crops are the alligator and
the orange. Although frosts have killed many in
late years, yet the product of the orange trees is
still large, Southern Florida containing the most
famous orange groves, especially along the Indian
River and on the lakes of the upper St. John's
River, where they are usually planted on the southern
borders of the lakes, so that the frost is killed by
the winds carrying it over the water, and thus the
orange trees are protected.</p>

<p class="center p2">THE LAND OF FLOWERS.</p>

<p>In the early sixteenth century there flourished a
valiant Spaniard of noble birth, a grandee of Aragon,
who had taken part in the conquest of Grenada,
Don Juan Ponce de Leon. He had accompanied
Columbus on one of his American voyages, and in
1510 was appointed Governor of Puerto Rico. The
bold Don Juan had become somewhat worn by a life
of dangerous buccaneering and romantic adventure,
and being rather advanced in years he was losing
the attractiveness which had long added charms to
his gallantries. From the Indians of Puerto Rico he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
heard of an island off to the northwestward, which
they called Bimini, and he listened with wonder and
constantly increasing interest to the tales they told
of an extraordinary and miraculous spring which it
contained that would restore youth to the aged and
health to the decrepit&mdash;the "Fountain of Perpetual
Youth." They described it as being in a region of
surpassing beauty, and said there were found abundant
gold and many slaves in this land of promise.
The rugged old warrior was fired with the prospect
of restored youth, and soon secured from the king a
grant of Bimini. In March, 1513, he sailed with a
large expedition from Puerto Rico, discovered some
of the Bahama Islands, coasted along the mainland to
latitude 30° 8' north, and on Easter Sunday, April
8th, landed a short distance south of St. John's
River and took possession, calling the country
Florida, from "Pasqua Florida," the Spanish name
for the day. He did not find the magic spring, however,
but he did discover a fairy scene, a land filled
with a profusion of fruits and flowers. Though he
subsequently diligently searched for it, he unfortunately
never found the miraculous fountain. He explored
the Gulf Coast, and returned to the quest
again in 1521, when he got into quarrels with the
Indians, was mortally wounded in a combat, and
went back to Cuba to die.</p>

<p>Another Spanish grandee, fired with zeal for gold
and conquest, appeared upon the scene somewhat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
later in the sixteenth century. Ferdinand de Soto,
a native of Jerez, whose only heritage was his sword
and shield, had accompanied various expeditions to
Darien and Nicaragua, and in 1532 joined Pizarro in
the conquest of Peru, where he acquired great wealth,
with which he returned to Spain. Soon after, being
anxious for more adventure, he was appointed Governor
of Cuba and Florida, and given a commission
to explore and settle the Spanish possessions in the
latter country, then including the whole northern
coast of the Gulf of Mexico. In May, 1539, he sailed
from Havana with a large fleet and six hundred men,
coasted around Florida and landed at Tampa Bay on
the Gulf side, where his explorations ashore began in
July. Fabulous stories had been told him of the
wealth of the country by those who had been there,
and De Soto's plan was to go everywhere in search
of gold. He captured Indians for guides, and found
a Spaniard, Juan Ortiz, whom they had taken captive
several years before, but who was now living
with them as a friend, knew their language and became
interpreter. Then De Soto, by his aid, began
a most difficult exploration, advancing through thick
woods, north and east, amid tangled undergrowth,
over bogs and marshes, crossing rivers and lakes,
fighting the Indians who resented his cruelties, for
he made them his slaves and bearers of burdens, tortured
and killed them if they resisted. But he found
no gold, though he pushed steadily onward, and turning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
westward in the quest, his numbers growing
smaller and the survivors weaker under the weight
of their privations. He travelled a long distance,
crossing Northern Florida and Georgia into the Carolinas,
and probably to Tennessee, descending the Alabama
River, and having a battle with the Indians
near Mobile Bay in October, 1540; then turning
again northward, crossing the Mississippi River,
which he discovered in May, 1541, near the Chickasaw
Bluffs, exploring it nearly to the mouth of the
Missouri, and then turning southward he sailed down
the river, and finally died of fever near the mouth of
Red River in May, 1542. During the three years'
wanderings nearly half his force had perished in battle,
or of privation and disease. The Indians were
in awe of him and believed him immortal, and a panic
therefore seized his surviving followers, who feared
annihilation if the savages discovered that De Soto
was dead. So they quietly buried him at night,
from a boat in midstream, sinking the corpse in the
great Father of Waters. Discouraged and almost
hopeless, his followers managed to build some small
vessels, and the next year arrived safely in Mexico.</p>

<p>Neither of these expeditions succeeded in colonizing
Florida, but they left a feeling of hatred among
the Indians, caused by the Spanish cruelties, which
always afterwards existed. In 1564 some French
Huguenots, led by René de Loudonnière, attempted
making a settlement at the mouth of St. John's River,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
and built Fort Caroline there. News of this reached
Spain, and in 1565 another colonization expedition
was sent out under Don Pedro Menendez d'Aviles,
which set sail from Cadiz, and on St. Augustine's
Day, August 28th, landed not far from where Ponce
de Leon had made his first invasion, and founded a
colony which he named St. Augustine, in honor of
his day of arrival. As soon as Menendez was established
on shore he attacked the Huguenots at St.
John's River, and hanged such of them as had escaped
being killed in the battle, declaring that he did
this because they were Protestants. Some of them
who had been away from the fort at the time were
afterwards shipwrecked near St. Augustine, and these
he also captured and put to death. The French Fort
Caroline was then garrisoned by the Spaniards, its
name changed to Fort San Mateo, and they also fortified
with redoubts both sides of the river entrance.
The story of the atrocities of Menendez was received
with indignation in France, but the King, controlled
by intrigue, dared do nothing, such was his fear of
the power of Spain.</p>

<p>Full vengeance was afterwards taken, however.
Dominique de Gourgues, a French gentleman of
Mont-de-Marsan, who hated the Spaniards with a
mortal hatred, took up the quarrel, sold his inheritance,
borrowed money, and equipped a small expedition
of three vessels and one hundred and eighty
men. He concealed his real object, and sailing for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
some time through the tropical seas, finally came to
Cuba, when he first made known his purpose to his
followers. He landed at St. Mary's River, opening
communication with the Indians, and a joint attack
upon the Spaniards to the southward was arranged.
In May, 1568, the fort and redoubts at St. John's
River were stormed and taken, a few Spaniards being
captured alive, all the rest having been slain in the
combat. Gourgues was shown nearby the trees
whereon Menendez had hanged the French prisoners
when he first took the fort, having placed over them
the inscription "Not as Frenchmen, but as Lutherans."
He hanged his Spanish prisoners on the same
trees, and over them was also nailed an inscription,
burned with a hot iron on a tablet of pine, "Not as
Spaniards, but as Traitors, Robbers and Murderers."
Gourgues' mission of vengeance was fulfilled. His
Indian allies demolished the fort and the redoubts at
the mouth of the river. He then sailed home with
his expedition, landing at Rochelle on the day of
Pentecost, where the Huguenots greeted him with
all honor, and whilst he was scorned at court and
lived for some years in obscurity, Queen Elizabeth
showed him great favor; and as he was going overland
to join the army of Portugal to once more fight
his enemies, the Spaniards, he fell ill at Tours and
died. The French made no more attempts at settlement
in Florida, and the Spaniards afterwards possessed
it, though frequently being at war with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
English. Spain finally ceded the "Land of Flowers"
to the United States, which took final possession in
1821.</p>

<p class="center p2">SOME FLORIDA PECULIARITIES.</p>

<p>Florida is a strange region, yet most attractive.
The traveller regards its surface as mainly a monotonous
level of forest and swamp, with fruit and floral
embellishments, but it in fact rises by an almost insensible
ascent from the coast towards the interior,
where there is a central summit ridge all along the
peninsula of about three hundred feet elevation, covered
with pine woods. Most of the surface, however,
is but a few feet above the sea-level, these
"flatlands," as they are called, being grass-grown
savannahs, pine woods, swamps and cabbage-palm
thickets. The southern part of the peninsula is the
region of the everglades, which have been formed by
successive dykes of coral, built by the industrious
little insect long ago. The upper part of this region
is occupied by the extensive but shallow waters of
Lake Okeechobee, which merges insensibly into the
everglades south and east, the Seminoles calling this
grass-grown and spongy region, which is still the
abode of some remnants of the tribe, Pa-ha-yo-kee,
meaning "much grass in water." These everglades
are penetrated in all directions by tortuous water
channels of slight depth; and at frequent intervals
in the whole district there are wooded islands possessing
fertile soils and covered with dense tropical vegetation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
These islands are said to have been surrounded
by the sea in bygone ages, and they then
stood in the same relation to the mainland as do the
present Southern Florida reefs and keys. Wide
tracts of cypress swamp separate the everglades
from the Gulf of Mexico, while in Southern Florida
they approach within a few miles of the Atlantic
Coast, being separated by an intervening dyke of
coral, crossed by frequent streams of rapid current,
for the everglades are far from being stagnant
swamps. There are also many other extensive
swamps in the State.</p>

<p>The Florida seacoast is usually protected by sand
beaches which are quite hard, and are separated
from the mainland by interior lagoons. The mangrove
and the coral, constantly growing, are ever encroaching,
however, on the sea-waters, and thus
Florida seems to have been constructed. The country
is full of water courses, lakes and springs, some
of the latter being regarded as among the most remarkable
in the world, the famous Silver Spring near
Ocala being estimated as discharging three hundred
millions of gallons daily. There are countless springs
along the coasts, and one of these bursts up in the
sea near St. Augustine, two miles off shore, with a
torrent so vigorous that the ocean waves break over
the column of fresh water as if it were a sunken
reef. Scientific investigators are amazed at the vast
amounts of water everywhere visible and discharged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
from these springs, and with only the narrow and low
peninsula for a watershed, the problem as to where
the vast water supply comes from baffles solution.
Some of the Florida lakes are subject to remarkable
fluctuations of level, and one of them, Lake Jackson,
ran suddenly dry at the time of the Charleston earthquake
in 1886, but after a few weeks the water began
returning, and it soon resumed its natural proportions.</p>

<p class="center p2">CUMBERLAND SOUND.</p>

<p>The memory of the Duke of Cumberland, son of
King George II., the victor of the battle of Culloden,
in Scotland, where he defeated the Pretender
in 1746, is preserved in America in the name of
Cumberland Sound, the finest harbor on the Southern
Atlantic Coast. St. Mary's River, coming out of
Okifenokee swamp to make the northern boundary
of Florida, flows an erratic course, boxing the compass
in every direction until it finally heads eastward
and debouches in Cumberland Sound, among a group
of islands forming a large landlocked harbor. This
river and sound, the boundary between Georgia and
Florida, were, prior to the Revolution, a disputed
frontier between the English and the Spaniards. To
the northward of the entrance from the sea is Cumberland
Island in Georgia, then comes Jekyll Island,
with its magnificent club-house and elaborate cottages,
and then St. Simon's Bay, having as its chief
port the busy lumber-shipping town of Brunswick.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
To the southward of the Cumberland entrance is
Amelia Island in Florida. The sound behind Amelia
and Cumberland Islands is a magnificent roadstead,
capable of floating at safe anchorage an enormous
fleet. Amelia Island is a long, narrow sand bank
with much foliage upon it, stretching about fourteen
miles down the Florida coast to Nassau Sound. On
the sea front of this island is one of the finest sand
beaches on the Atlantic. Behind it is the arm of the
sea known as Amelia River, and the port of Fernandina,
thirty-six miles northeast of Jacksonville,
having at the point of the island, guarding the entrance
to its harbor, old Fort Clinch, a superannuated
brick-work battery, formerly of great importance,
but now of little use, though it was somewhat
strengthened to meet the exigencies of the recent
Spanish War.</p>

<p>The French Huguenots first came along here and
settled, as they did at the St. John's River entrance,
and they called the island Garde. They found here
a powerful Indian tribe, whose chief, the "Cacique
of Garde," their historian described as "handsome
and noble," and his queen as "beautiful and modest,"
and the same authority says they had "five handsome
daughters." The French were engaged in desultory
quarrels with the Spaniards south of them at
St. Augustine, and the young gallants of the colony,
in the intervals of the warfare, alternately courted
and jilted the Indian maidens, the result being a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
savage attack and massacre; and finally, between
Indian and Spanish enmity, the settlement disappeared.
But the English, made of sterner stuff, ultimately
came along, settling Georgia, and giving
British names to the islands, the rivers and the
Sound, which they still retain. For a long time this
was disputed territory between the English and the
Spaniards, the latter claiming everything northward
to Carolina. General Oglethorpe marched through
here to attack St. Augustine, and in 1763 the British
held Amelia Island, extending the little fort to almost
its present proportions, and laying out a town behind
it, while to the southward the Countess of Egmont
established an indigo plantation, which flourished for
a brief period. Spain ultimately got the island, and
it came into American possession with Florida in
1821. A little town with sandy streets, a pretty
park, much foliage, delicious air bringing the balsam
of the pines and the tonic of the sea, and hotels accommodating
the influx of winter visitors, make up
the Fernandina of to-day. Its beach on the ocean
front, more than a mile away, is one of the finest in
existence, hard as a floor, level and broad, stretching
as far as eye can see, and having a grand surf
booming upon it.</p>

<p>On Cumberland Island is the estate of Dungeness.
General Nathaniel Greene of Rhode Island, one of
Washington's most trusted officers, was the commander
of the Revolutionary armies in the South in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
1780-81 which drove the British out of that section,
gained the victory of Cowpens in South Carolina, and
compelled the withdrawal of Cornwallis to Yorktown,
which ended in his surrender. After the close of the
war, in gratitude for his great services, the people of
Georgia presented him with this estate of about ten
thousand acres. He made it his home for a time, but
it afterwards passed away from his family, and being
neglected, the old coquina stone mansion was burnt.
The house has since been reconstructed, and a picturesque
avenue of moss-hung live oaks a mile long
stretches over the island near it to the sea. In a little
cemetery on the estate are the graves of General
Greene's widow and daughter. Here is also the
grave of "Light Horse Harry" of the Revolution
(the father of General Robert E. Lee), who died abroad
in 1818. He had visited and loved Dungeness,
and requested to be buried there. Oaks and palmettos
embower these modest graves, which are
carefully preserved.</p>

<p class="center p2">ANCIENT ST. AUGUSTINE.</p>

<p>St. Augustine, thirty-six miles southeast of Jacksonville,
on the seacoast, is the oldest city in the
United States, founded by Menendez in 1565, and
existing to this day with the characteristics of a
Spanish town of the sixteenth century, which have
been also reproduced in the architecture of most of the
newer buildings. A small inlet from the ocean, about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
fifteen miles south of the mouth of St. John's River,
stretches its arms north and south, the latter arm,
called Matanzas River, seeking the sea again about
eighteen miles below. It thus forms Anastasia Island,
sheltering the harbor like a breakwater, and behind
it the city is built, being protected by a sea-wall
nearly a mile long, built of coquina or shell-stone.
Another arm of the sea, called San Sebastian River,
is a short distance inland, so that the town site is
really upon a peninsula. About five thousand people
reside permanently in St. Augustine, a few of Spanish
descent, and more of them the offspring of a
colony of Minorcans who came in 1769, but in winter
the Northern visitors to the palatial hotels swell the
population to over ten thousand. The town is built
on a level sandy plain, and the older streets are narrow,
being only a few feet wide and without sidewalks.
The projecting balconies of some of the ancient
houses almost touch those opposite. The old
streets are paved with coquina and the old houses
are built of it, this curious shell-limestone, quarried
on Anastasia Island, hardening upon exposure to the
air. A few streets running north and south, crossed
by others at right angles, and a broader front street
bordered by the sea-wall which makes a fine promenade,
compose the town. This sea-wall of coquina
is capped with granite, and was built after the American
occupation of the city. At its northern end is
Fort Marion and at the southern end St. Francis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
Barracks, the United States military post, so named
because it occupies the site of the old Convent of St.
Francis, having some of its coquina walls incorporated
in the present structure. The harbor in front, which
in past centuries sheltered so many Spanish fleets
and those of Spanish enemies as well, is now chiefly
devoted to yachting.</p>

<p>When Menendez and his Spaniards first landed
they built a wooden fort commanding the harbor entrance,
surrounded by pine trees, which they named
San Juan de Pinos. This was afterwards replaced
by Fort San Marco, constructed of coquina, which
was nearly a hundred years building, and was finished
in 1756. Upon the transfer of Florida to the
United States this became Fort Marion. It is a well-preserved
specimen of the military architecture of the
eighteenth century, built on Vauban's system, covering
about four acres, with bastions at the corners,
each protected by a watch-tower, and is surrounded
by a moat, the walls being twenty-one feet high.
The fort is in reasonably good preservation, and is
said to have been constructed mainly by the labor of
Indians. It took so long to build and cost so much
under the wasteful Spanish system that one sovereign
wrote that it had almost cost its weight in gold; yet it
was regarded then as supremely important to be finished,
being the key to the Spanish possession of
Florida. Over the sally-port at the drawbridge are
carved the Spanish arms and an inscription recording
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
the completion of the fort in 1756, when Ferdinand
VI. was King of Spain and Don Hereda Governor of
Florida. It mounted one hundred of the small guns
of those days, and the interior is a square parade
ground, surrounded by large casemates. Upon
each side of the casemate opposite the sally-port
is a niche for holy water, and at the farther end
the Chapel. Dungeons and subterranean passages
abound, of which ghostly tales are told. This fort
is the most interesting relic of the ancient city, a
picturesque place, with charms even in its dilapidation.</p>

<p>There are other quaint structures in this curious
old town. A gray gateway about ten feet wide,
flanked by tall square towers, marks the northern
entrance to the city, the ditch from the fort passing
in front of it. In one of the streets is the palace of
the Spanish Governors, since changed into a post-office.
The official centre of the city is a public
square, the Plaza de la Constitucion, having a monument
commemorating the Spanish Liberal Constitution
of 1812, and also a Confederate Soldiers' Monument.
This square fronts on the sea-wall, and
alongside it and stretching westward is the Alameda,
known as King Street, leading to the group of grand
hotels recently constructed in Spanish and Moorish
style, which have made modern St. Augustine so
famous. These are the Ponce de Leon, the Alcazar
and the Cordova, with the Casino, adjoined by spacious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
and beautiful gardens. These buildings reproduce
all types of the Hispano-Moorish architecture,
with many suggestions from the Alhambra. The
Ponce de Leon, the largest, is three hundred and
eighty by five hundred and twenty feet, enclosing
an open court, and its towers rise above the red-tiled
roofs to a height of one hundred and sixty-five feet,
the adornments in colors being very effective. To
the southward of the town, adjoining the barracks, is
the military cemetery, where a monument and three
white pyramids tell the horrid story of the Dade massacre
during the Seminole War. Major Dade, a gallant
officer, and one hundred and seven men, were
ambushed and massacred by eight hundred Indians
in December, 1835, and their remains afterwards
brought here and interred under the pyramids. Opposite
the barracks is what is claimed to be the oldest
house in the United States, occupied by Franciscan
monks from 1565 to 1580, and afterwards a dwelling.
It has been restored, and contains a collection of historical
relics.</p>

<p>St. Augustine has had a chequered history. In
1586, Queen Elizabeth's naval hero, Sir Francis
Drake, sailing all over the world to fight Spaniards,
attacked and plundered the town and burnt the
greater part of it. Then for nearly a century the
Indians, pirates, French, English and neighboring
Georgians and Carolinians made matters lively for
the harried inhabitants. In 1763 the British came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
into possession, but they ceded it back to Spain
twenty years later, the town then containing about
three hundred householders and nine hundred negroes.
It became American in 1821, and was an
important military post during the subsequent Seminole
War, which continued several years. It was
early captured by the Union forces during the Civil
War, and was a valuable stronghold for them. This
curious old town has many traditions that tell of war
and massacre and the horrible cruelties of the Spanish
Inquisition, the remains of cages in which prisoners
were starved to death being shown in the fort.
Its best modern story, however, is told of the escape
of Coa-coo-chee, the Seminole chief, whose adventurous
spirit and savage nature gained him the name of
the "Wild Cat." The ending of the Seminole War
was the signing of a treaty by the older chiefs agreeing
to remove west of the Mississippi. Coa-coo-chee,
with other younger chiefs, opposed this and renewed
the conflict. He was ultimately captured and taken
to Fort Marion. Feigning sickness, he was removed
into a casemate giving him air, there being an aperture
two feet high by nine inches wide in the wall
about thirteen feet above the floor, and under it a
platform five feet high. Here, while still feigning
illness, he became attenuated by voluntary abstinence
from food, and finally one night squeezed himself
through the aperture and dropped to the bottom of
the moat, which was dry. Eluding all the guards, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
escaped and rejoined his people. The flight caused
a great sensation, and there was hot pursuit. After
some time he was recaptured, and being taken before
General Worth, was used to compel the remnant of
the tribe to remove to the West. Worth told him if
his people were not at Tampa in twenty days he
would be killed, and he was ordered to notify them
by Indian runners. He hesitated, but afterwards
yielded, and the runners were given twenty twigs,
one to be broken each day, so they might know
when the last one was broken his life would pay the
penalty. In seventeen days the task was accomplished.
The tribe came to Tampa, and the captive
was released, accompanying his warriors to the far
West. This ended most of the Indian troubles in
Florida, but some descendants of the Seminoles still
exist in the remote fastnesses of the everglades.</p>

<p class="center p2">THE FLORIDA EAST COAST.</p>

<p>All along the Atlantic shore of Florida south of St.
Augustine are popular winter resorts, their broad
and attractive beaches, fine climate and prolific tropical
vegetation being among the charms that bring
visitors. Ormond is between the ocean front and
the pleasant Halifax River, its picturesque tributary,
the Tomoka, being a favorite resort for picnic parties.
A few miles south on the Halifax River is
Daytona, known as the "Fountain City," and having
its suburb, "the City Beautiful," on the opposite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
bank. New Smyrna, settled by Minorcan indigo
planters in the eighteenth century, is on the northern
arm of Indian River. Here are found some of the
ancient Indian shell mounds that are frequent in
Florida, and also the orange groves that make this
region famous. Inland about thirty miles are a group
of pretty lakes, and in the pines at Lake Helen is
located the "Southern Cassadaga," or Spiritualists'
Assembly. For more than a hundred and fifty miles
the noted Indian River stretches down the coast of
Florida. It is a long and narrow lagoon, parallel
with the ocean, and is part of the series of lagoons
found on the eastern coast almost continuously for
more than three hundred miles from St. Augustine
south to Biscayne Bay, and varying in width from
about fifty yards to six or more miles. They are
shallow waters, rarely over twelve feet deep, and are
entered by very shallow inlets from the sea. The
Indian River shores, stretching down to Jupiter
Inlet, are lined with luxuriant vegetation, and the
water is at times highly phosphorescent. Upon the
western shore are most of the celebrated Indian
River orange groves whose product is so highly
prized. At Titusville, the head of navigation, where
there are about a thousand people, the river is about,
at its widest part, six miles. Twenty miles below,
at Rockledge, it narrows to about a mile in width,
washing against the perpendicular sides of a continuous
enclosing ledge of coquina rock, with pleasant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
overhanging trees. Here comes in, around an island,
its eastern arm, the Banana River, and to the many
orange groves are added plantations of the luscious
pineapple. Various limpid streams flow out from
the everglade region at the westward, and Fort Pierce
is the trading station for that district, to which the
remnant of the Seminoles come to exchange alligator
hides, bird plumage and snake skins for various supplies,
not forgetting "fire-water." Below this is the
wide estuary of St. Lucie River and the Jupiter
River, with the lighthouse on the ocean's edge at
Jupiter Inlet, the mouth of Indian River.</p>

<p>Seventeen miles below this Inlet is Palm Beach, a
noted resort, situated upon the narrow strip of land
between the long and narrow lagoon of Lake Worth
and the Atlantic Ocean. Here are the vast Hotel
Royal Poinciana and the Palm Beach Inn, with their
cocoanut groves, which also fringe for miles the
pleasant shores of Lake Worth. Prolific vegetation
and every charm that can add to this American
Riviera bring a crowded winter population. The
Poinciana is a tree bearing gorgeous flowers, and
the two magnificent hotels, surrounded by an extensive
tropical paradise, are connected by a wide avenue
of palms a half-mile long, one house facing the
lake and the other the ocean. There is not a horse
in the settlement, and only one mule, whose duty is
to haul a light summer car between the houses. The
vehicles of Palm Beach are said to be confined to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
"bicycles, wheel-chairs and jinrickshas." Off to the
westward the distant horizon is bounded by the mysterious
region of the everglades. Far down the
coast the railway terminates at Miami, the southernmost
railway station in the United States, a little
town on Miami River, where it enters the broad expanse
of Biscayne Bay, which is separated from the
Atlantic by the first of the long chain of Florida
keys. Here are many fruit and vegetable plantations,
and the town, which is a railway terminal and
steamship port for lines to Nassau, Key West and
Havana, is growing. Nassau is but one hundred and
seventy-five miles distant in the Bahamas, off the
Southern Florida coast, and has become a favorite
American winter tourist resort.</p>

<p class="center p2">ASCENDING ST. JOHN'S RIVER.</p>

<p>The St. John's is the great river of Florida, rising
in the region of lakes, swamps and savannahs in the
lower peninsula, and flowing northward four hundred
miles to Jacksonville, then turning eastward to
the ocean. It comes through a low and level region,
with mostly a sluggish current; is bordered by dense
foliage, and in its northern portion is a series of
lagoons varying in width from one to six miles. The
river is navigable fully two hundred miles above
Jacksonville. The earlier portion of the journey is
monotonous, the shores being distant and the landings
made at long piers jutting out over the shallows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
from the villages and plantations. At Mandarin is
the orange grove which was formerly the winter
home of Harriet Beecher Stowe; Magnolia amid the
pines is a resort for consumptives; and nearby is
Green Cove Springs, having a large sulphur spring
of medicinal virtue. In all directions stretch the
pine forests; and the river water, while clear and
sparkling in the sunlight, is colored a dark amber
from the swamps whence it comes. The original Indian
name of this river was We-la-ka, or a "chain
of lakes," the literal meaning, in the figurative idea
of the savage, being "the water has its own way."
It broadens into various bays, and at one of these,
about seventy-five miles south of Jacksonville, is the
chief town of the upper river, Palatka, having about
thirty-five hundred inhabitants and a much greater
winter population. It is largely a Yankee town,
shipping oranges and early vegetables to the North;
and across the river, just above, is one of the leading
orange plantations of Florida&mdash;Colonel Hart's, a
Vermonter who came here dying of consumption,
but lived to become, in his time, the leading fruit-grower
of the State. Above Palatka the river is
narrower, excepting where it may broaden into a
lake; the foliage is greener, the shores more swampy,
the wild-fowl more frequent, and the cypress tree
more general. The young "cypress knees" can be
seen starting up along the swampy edge of the shore,
looking like so many champagne bottles set to cool
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
in the water. The river also becomes quite crooked,
and here is an ancient Spanish and Indian settlement,
well named Welaka, opposite which flows in the
weird Ocklawaha River, the haunt of the alligator
and renowned as the crookedest stream on the continent.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i141" id="i141"></a>
<img src="images/i141.jpg" width="391" height="550" alt=""  />
<p class="caption"><i>On the Ocklawaha</i></p>
</div>
<p class="center p2">GOING DOWN THE OCKLAWAHA.</p>

<p>The Ocklawaha, the "dark, crooked water," comes
from the south, by tortuous windings, through various
lakes and swamps, and then turns east and southeast
to flow into St. John's River, after a course of
over three hundred miles. It rises in Lake Apopka,
down the Peninsula, elevated about a hundred feet
above the sea, the second largest of the Florida Lakes,
and covering one hundred and fifty square miles.
This lake has wooded highlands to the westward,
dignified by the title of Apopka Mountains, which
rise probably one hundred and twenty feet above its
surface. To the northward is a group of lakes&mdash;Griffin,
Yale, Eustis, Dora, Harris and others&mdash;having
clear amber waters and low shores, which are all
united by the Ocklawaha, the stream finally flowing
northward out of Lake Griffin. This is a region of
extensive settlement, mainly by Northern people.
The mouth of the Ocklawaha is sixty-five miles from
Lake Eustis in a straight line, but the river goes two
hundred and thirty miles to get there. To the northward
of this lake district is the thriving town of
Ocala, with five thousand people, in a region of good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>
agriculture and having large phosphate beds, the settlement
having been originally started as a military
post during the Seminole War. About five miles
east of Ocala is the famous Silver Spring, which is
believed to have been the "fountain of perpetual
youth," for which Juan Ponce de Leon vainly
searched. It is the largest and most beautiful of the
many Florida springs, having wonderfully clear
waters, and covers about three acres. The waters
can be plainly seen pouring upwards through fissures
in the rocky bottom, like an inverted Niagara, eighty
feet beneath the surface. It has an enormous outflow,
and a swift brook runs from it, a hundred feet
wide, for some eight miles to the Ocklawaha.</p>

<p>This strange stream is hardly a river in the ordinary
sense, having fixed banks and a well-defined
channel, but is rather a tortuous but navigable passage
through a succession of lagoons and cypress
swamps. Above the Silver Spring outlet, only the
smallest boats of light draft can get through the
crooked channel. This outlet is thirty miles in a
direct line from the mouth of the river at the St.
John's, but the Ocklawaha goes one hundred and
nine miles thither. The swampy border of the stream
is rarely more than a mile broad, and beyond it are
the higher pine lands. Through this curious channel,
amid the thick cypress forests and dense jungle
of undergrowth, the wayward and crooked river
meanders. The swampy bottom in which it has its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
course is so low-lying as to be undrainable and cannot
be improved, so that it will probably always remain
as now, a refuge for the sub-tropical animals,
birds, reptiles and insects of Florida, which abound in
its inmost recesses. Here flourishes the alligator, coming
out to sun himself at mid-day on the logs and
warm grassy lagoons at the edge of the stream, in
just the kinds of places one would expect to find
him. Yet the alligator is said to be a coward, rarely
attacking, unless his retreat to water in which to hide
himself is cut off. He thus becomes more a curiosity
than a foe. These reptiles are hatched from eggs
which the female deposits during the spring, in large
numbers, in muddy places, where she digs out a spacious
cavity, fills it with several hundred eggs, and
covering them thickly with mud, leaves nature to do
the rest. After a long incubation the little fellows
come out and make a bee-line for the nearest water.
The big alligators of the neighborhood have many
breakfasts on the newly-born little ones, but some
manage to grow up, after several years, to maturity,
and exhibit themselves along this remarkable river.</p>

<p>It is almost impossible to conceive of the concentrated
crookedness of the Ocklawaha and the difficulties
of passage. It is navigated by stout and narrow
flat-bottomed boats of light draft, constructed so as
to quickly turn sharp corners, bump the shores and
run on logs without injury. The river turns constantly
at short intervals and doubles upon itself in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
almost every mile, while the huge cypress trees often
compress the water way so that a wider boat could
not get through. There are many beautiful views
in its course displaying the noble ranks of cypress
trees rising as the stream bends along its bordering
edge of swamps. Occasionally a comparatively
straight river reach opens like the aisle of a grand
building with the moss-hung cypress columns in long
and sombre rows on either hand. At rare intervals
fast land comes down to the stream bank, where there
is some cultivation attempted for oranges and vegetables.
Terrapin, turtles and water-fowl abound.
When the passenger boat, after bumping and swinging
around the corners, much like a ponderous teetotum,
halts for a moment at a landing in this swampy
fastness, half-clad negroes usually appear, offering for
sale partly-grown baby alligators, which are the prolific
crop of the district. Various "Turkey bends,"
"Hell's half-acres," "Log Jams," "Bone Yards"
and "Double S Bends" are passed, and at one place
is the "Cypress Gate," where three large trees are
in the way, and by chopping off parts of their roots,
a passage about twenty feet wide had been secured
to let the boats through. There are said to be two
thousand bends in one hundred miles of this stream,
and many of them are like corrugated circles, by
which the narrow water way, in a mile or two of its
course, manages to twist back to within a few feet of
where it started. At night, to aid the navigation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
the lurid glare of huge pine-knot torches, fitfully
blazing, gives the scene a weird and unnatural aspect.
The monotonous sameness of cypress trunks, sombre
moss and twisting stream for many hours finally becomes
very tiresome, but it is nevertheless a most remarkable
journey of the strangest character possible
in this country to sail down the Ocklawaha.</p>

<p class="center p2">LOWER FLORIDA AND THE SEMINOLES.</p>

<p>South of the mouth of the Ocklawaha the St.
John's River broadens into Lake George, the largest
of its many lakes, a pretty sheet of water six to nine
miles wide and twelve miles long. Volusia, the site
of an ancient Spanish mission, is at the head of this
lake, and the discharge from the swift but narrow
stream above has made sand bars, so that jetties are
constructed to deepen the channel. For a long distance
the upper river is narrow and tortuous, with
numerous islands and swamps, the dark coffee-colored
water disclosing its origin; but the Blue Spring in
one place is unique, sending out an ample and rich
blue current to mix with the amber. Then Lake
Monroe is reached, ten miles long and five miles wide,
the head of navigation, by the regular lines of
steamers, one hundred and seventy miles above
Jacksonville. Here are two flourishing towns, Enterprise
on the northern shore and Sanford on the
southern, both popular winter resorts, and the latter
having two thousand people. The St. John's extends
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
above Lake Monroe, a crooked, narrow, shallow
stream, two hundred and fourteen miles farther southeastward
to its source. The region through which
it there passes is mostly a prairie with herds of cattle
and much game, and is only sparsely settled. The
upper river approaches the seacoast, being in one
place but three miles from the lagoons bordering the
Atlantic. To the southward of Lake Monroe are the
winter resorts of Winter Park and Orlando, the latter
a town of three thousand population. There are numerous
lakes in this district, and then leaving the
St. John's valley and crossing the watershed southward
through the pine forests, the Okeechobee waters
are reached, which flow down to that lake. This region
was the home of a part of the Seminole Indians,
and Tohopekaliga was their chief, whom they revered
so highly that they named their largest lake
in his honor. The Kissimmee River flows southward
through this lake, and then traverses a succession of
lakes and swamps to Lake Okeechobee, about two
hundred miles southward by the water-line. Kissimmee
City is on Lake Tohopekaliga, and extensive
drainage operations have been conducted here and to
the southward, reclaiming a large extent of valuable
lands, and lowering the water-level in all these lakes
and attendant swamps.</p>

<p>From Lake Tohopekaliga through the tortuous
water route to Lake Okeechobee, and thence by the
Caloosahatchie westward to the Gulf of Mexico, is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
winding channel of four hundred and sixty miles,
though in a direct line the distance is but one hundred
and fifty miles. Okeechobee, the word meaning
the "large water," covers about twelve hundred
and fifty square miles, and almost all about it are the
everglades or "grass water," the shores being generally
a swampy jungle. This district for many
miles is a mass of waving sedge grass eight to ten
feet high above the water, and inaccessible excepting
through narrow, winding and generally hidden channels.
In one locality a few tall lone pines stand like
sentinels upon Arpeika Island, formerly the home of
the bravest and most dreaded of the Seminoles, and
still occupied by some of their descendants. The
name of the Seminole means the "separatist" or
"runaway" Indians, they having centuries ago separated
from the Creeks in Georgia and gone southward
into Florida. From the days of De Soto to
the time of their deportation in the nineteenth century
the Spanish, British, French and Americans
made war with these Seminole Indians. Gradually
they were pressed southward through Florida. Their
final refuge was the green islands and hummocks of the
everglades, and they then clung to their last homes
with the tenacity of despair. The greater part of
this region is an unexplored mystery; the deep
silence that can be actually felt, everywhere pervades;
and once lost within the labyrinth, the adventurer
is doomed unless rescued. Only the Indians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>
knew its concealed and devious paths. On
Arpeika Island the Cacique of the Caribs is said to
have ruled centuries ago, until forced south out of
Florida by the Seminoles. It was at times a refuge
for the buccaneer with his plunder and a shrine for
the missionary martyr who planted the Cross and
was murdered beside it. This island was the last
retreat of the Seminoles in the desultory war from
1835 to 1843, when they defied the Government,
which, during eight years, spent $50,000,000 upon
expeditions sent against them. Then the attempt to
remove all of them was abandoned, and the remnant
have since rested in peace, living by hunting and a
little trading with the coast settlements. The names
of the noted chiefs of this great race&mdash;Osceola,
Tallahassee, Tohopekaliga, Coa-coo-chee and others&mdash;are
preserved in the lakes, streams and towns
of Florida. Most of the deported tribe were sent
to the Indian Territory. There may be three or
four hundred of them still in the everglades, peaceful,
it is true, yet haughty and suspicious, and sturdily
rejecting all efforts to educate or civilize them.
They celebrate their great feast, the "Green Corn
Dance," in late June; and they have unwavering
faith in the belief that the time will yet come
when all their prized everglade land will be theirs
again, and the glory of the past redeemed, if not in
this world, then in the next one, beyond the "Big
Sleep."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2">WESTERN FLORIDA.</p>

<p>Westward from Jacksonville, a railway runs
through the pine forests until it reaches the rushing
Suwanee River, draining the Okifenokee swamp out
to the Gulf, just north of Cedar Key. This stream is
best known from the minstrel song, long so popular,
of the <i>Old Folks at Home</i>. Beyond it the land rises
into the rolling country of Middle Florida, the undulating
surface sometimes reaching four hundred feet
elevation, and presenting fertile soil and pleasant
scenery, with a less tropical vegetation than the
Peninsula of Florida. Here is Tallahassee, the capital
of the State, one hundred and sixty-five miles
from Jacksonville, a beautiful town of four thousand
population, almost embedded in flowering plants,
shrubbery and evergreens, and familiarly known
from these beauties as the "Floral City," the gardens
being especially attractive in the season of
roses. The Capitol and Court-house and West
Florida Seminary, set on a hill, are the chief public
buildings. In the suburbs, at Monticello, lived
Prince Achille Murat, a son of the King of Naples,
who died in 1847, and his grave is in the Episcopal
Cemetery. There are several lakes near the town,
one of them the curious Lake Miccosukie, which
contracts into a creek, finally disappearing underground.
The noted Wakulla Spring, an immense
limestone basin of great depth and volume of water,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
with wonderful transparency, is fifteen miles southward.</p>

<p>Some distance to the westward the Flint and Chattahoochee
Rivers join to form the Appalachicola
River, flowing down to the Gulf at Appalachicola, a
somewhat decadent port from loss of trade, its exports
being principally lumber and cotton. The shallowness
of most of these Gulf harbors, which readily
silt up, destroys their usefulness as ports for deep-draft
shipping. The route farther westward skirts
the Gulf Coast, crosses Escambia Bay and reaches
Pensacola, on its spacious harbor, ten miles within
the Gulf. This is the chief Western Florida port,
with fifteen thousand people, having a Navy Yard
and much trade in lumber, cotton, coal and grain, a
large elevator for the latter being erected in 1898.
The Spaniards made this a frontier post in 1696, and
the remains of their forts, San Miguel and San Bernardo,
can be seen behind the town, while near the
outer edge of the harbor is the old-time Spanish defensive
battery, Fort San Carlos de Barrancos. The
harbor entrance is now defended by Fort Pickens and
Fort McRae. Pensacola Bay was the scene of one of
the first spirited naval combats of the Civil War,
when the Union forces early in 1862 recaptured the
Navy Yard and defenses. The name of Pensacola
was originally given by the Choctaws to the bearded
Europeans who first settled there, and signifies the
"hair people."

<p class="center p2">THE FLORIDA GULF COAST.</p>

<p>The coast of Florida on the Gulf of Mexico has
various attractive places, reached by a convenient
railway system. Homosassa is a popular resort
about fifty miles southwestward from Ocala. A short
distance in the interior is the locality where the Seminoles
surprised and massacred Major Dade and his
men in December, 1835, only three soldiers escaping
alive to tell the horrid tale. The operations against
these Indians were then mainly conducted from the
military post of Tampa, and thither were taken for
deportation the portions of the tribe that were afterwards
captured, or who surrendered under the treaty.
When Ferdinand de Soto entered this magnificent
harbor on his voyage of discovery and gold hunting,
he called it Espiritu Sancto Bay. It is from six to
fifteen miles wide, and stretches nearly forty miles
into the land, being dotted with islands, its waters
swarming with sea-fowl, turtles and fish, deer abounding
in the interior and on some of the islands, and
there being abundant anchorage for the largest vessels.
This is the great Florida harbor and the chief
winter resort on the western coast. It was the main
port of rendezvous and embarkation for the American
forces in the Spanish War of 1898. The head
of the harbor divides into Old Tampa and Hillsborough
Bays, and on the latter and at the mouth of
Hillsborough River is the city, numbering about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
twenty-five thousand inhabitants. The great hotels
are surrounded by groves with orange and lemon
trees abounding, and everything is invoked that can
add to the tourist attractions. The special industry
of the resident population is cigar-making. Port
Tampa is out upon the Peninsula between the two
bays, several miles below the city, and a long railway
trestle leads from the shore for a mile to deep water.
Upon the outer end of this long wharf is Tampa Inn,
built on a mass of piles, much like some of the constructions
in Venice. The guests can almost catch
fish out of the bedroom windows, and while eating
breakfast can watch the pelican go fishing in the
neighboring waters, for this queer-looking bird, with
the duck and gull, is everywhere seen in these attractive
regions. An outer line of keys defends
Tampa harbor from the storms of the Gulf. There
are many popular resorts on the islands and shores
of Tampa Bay, and regular lines of steamers are run
to the West India ports, Mobile and New Orleans.
All the surroundings are attractive, and a pleased
visitor writes of the place: "Conditions hereabouts
exhilarate the men; a perpetual sun and ocean breeze
are balm to the invalid and an inspiration to a robust
health. The landscape affords uncommon diversion,
and the sea its royal sport with rod and gaff."</p>

<p>Farther down the coast is Charlotte Harbor, also
deeply indented and sheltered from the sea by various
outlying islands. It is eight to ten miles long and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
extends twenty-five miles into the land, having valuable
oyster-beds and fisheries, and its port is Punta
Gorda. Below this is the projecting shore of Punta
Rassa, where the outlet of Lake Okeechobee, the
Caloosahatchie River, flows to the sea, having the
military post of Fort Myers, another popular resort,
a short distance inland, upon its bank. The Gulf
Coast now trends to the southeast, with various bays,
in one of which, with Cape Romano as the guarding
headland, is the archipelago of "the ten thousand
islands," while below is Cape Sable, the southwestern
extremity of Florida. To the southward, distant
from the shore, are the long line of Florida Keys, the
name coming from the Spanish word <i>cayo</i>, an island.
This remarkable coral formation marks the northern
limit of the Gulf Stream, where it flows swiftly out
to round the extremity of the Peninsula and begin
its northern course through the Atlantic Ocean.
Although well lighted and charted, the Straits of
Florida along these reefs are dangerous to navigate
and need special pilots. Nowhere rising more than
eight to twelve feet above the sea, the Keys thus
low-lying are luxuriantly covered with tropical vegetation.
From the Dry Tortugas at the west, around
to Sand's Key at the entrance to Biscayne Bay, off
the Atlantic Coast, about two hundred miles, is a
continuous reef of coral, upon the whole extent of
which the little builder is still industriously working.
The reef is occasionally broken by channels of varying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
depth, and within the outer line are many habitable
islands. The whole space inside this reef is
slowly filling up, just as all the Keys are also slowly
growing through accretions from floating substances
becoming entangled in the myriad roots of the mangroves.
The present Florida Reef is a good example
of the way in which a large part of the Peninsula
was formed. No less than seven old coral reefs have
been found to exist south of Lake Okeechobee, and
the present one at the very edge of the deep water
of the Gulf Stream is probably the last that can
be formed, as the little coral-builder cannot live
at a greater depth than sixty feet. The Gulf Stream
current is so swift and deep along the outer reef
that there is no longer a foundation on which to
build.</p>

<p>The Gulf Stream is the best known of all the
great ocean currents. The northeast and southeast
trade-winds, constantly blowing, drive a great mass of
water from the Atlantic Ocean into the Caribbean
Sea, and westward through the passages between the
Windward Islands, which is contracted by the converging
shores of the Yucatan Peninsula and the
Island of Cuba, so that it pours between them into
the Gulf of Mexico, raising its surface considerably
above the level of the Atlantic. These currents then
move towards the Florida Peninsula, and pass around
the Florida Reef and out into the Atlantic. It is
estimated by the Coast Survey that the hourly flow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>
of the Gulf Stream past the reef is nearly ninety
thousand million tons of water, the speed at the surface
of the axis of the stream being over three and
one-half miles an hour. To conceive what the immensity
of this flow means, it is stated that if a single
hour's flow of water were evaporated, the salt thus
produced would require to carry it one hundred times
the number of ocean-going vessels now afloat. The
Gulf Stream water is of high temperature, great
clearness and a deep blue color; and when it meets
the greener waters of the Atlantic to the northward,
the line of distinction is often very well defined. At
the exit to the Atlantic below Jupiter Inlet the
stream is forty-eight miles wide to Little Bahama
Bank, and its depth over four hundred fathoms.</p>

<p>There are numerous harbors of refuge among the
Florida Keys, and that at Key West is the best.
This is a coral island seven miles long and one to
two miles broad, but nowhere elevated more than
eleven feet above the sea. Its name, by a free translation,
comes from the original Spanish name of
<i>Cayo Hueso</i>, or the Bone Island, given because the
early mariners found human bones upon it. Here
are twenty thousand people, mostly Cubans and settlers
from the Bahamas, the chief industry being
cigar-making, while catching fish and turtles and
gathering sponges also give much employment.
There are no springs on the island, and the inhabitants
are dependent on rain or distillation for water.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>
The air is pure and the climate healthy, the trees and
shrubbery, with the residences embowered in perennial
flowers, giving the city a picturesque appearance.
Key West has a good harbor, and as it commands the
gateway to and from the Gulf near the western extremity
of the Florida coral reef, it is strongly defended,
the prominent work being Fort Taylor, constructed
on an artificial island within the main harbor
entrance. The little Sand Key, seven miles to the
southwest, is the southernmost point of the United
States. Forty miles to the westward is the group
of ten small, low and barren islands known as the
Dry Tortugas, from the Spanish <i>tortuga</i>, a tortoise.
Upon the farthest one, Loggerhead Key, stands the
great guiding light for the Florida Reef, of which this
is the western extremity, the tower rising one hundred
and fifty feet. Fort Jefferson is on Garden
Key, where there is a harbor, and in it were confined
various political prisoners during the Civil War,
among them some who were concerned in the conspiracy
to assassinate President Lincoln.</p>

<p>Here, with the encircling waters of the Gulf all
around us, terminates this visit to the Sunny South.
As we have progressed, the gradual blending of the
temperate into the torrid zone, with the changing
vegetation, has reminded of Bayard Taylor's words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"There, in the wondering airs of the Tropics,</p>
<p>Shivers the Aspen, still dreaming of cold:</p>
<p>There stretches the Oak from the loftiest ledges,</p>
<p>His arms to the far-away lands of his brothers,</p>
<p>And the Pine tree looks down on his rival, the Palm."</p>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span></p>

<p>And as the journey down the Florida Peninsula
has displayed some of the most magnificent winter
resorts of the American Riviera, with their wealth
of tropical foliage, fruits and flowers, and their seductive
and balmy climate, this too has reminded of Cardinal
Damiani's glimpse of the "Joys of Heaven":</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Stormy winter, burning summer, rage within these regions never,</p>
<p>But perpetual bloom of roses and unfading spring forever;</p>
<p>Lilies gleam, the crocus glows, and dropping balms their scents deliver."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Along this famous peninsula the sea rolls with
ceaseless beat upon some of the most gorgeous
beaches of the American coast. To the glories of
tropical vegetation and the charms of the climate,
Florida thus adds the magnificence of its unrivalled
marine environment. Everywhere upon these pleasant
coasts&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="i9">"The bridegroom, Sea,</p>
<p>Is toying with his wedded bride,&mdash;the Shore.</p>
<p>He decorates her shining brow with shells,</p>

<p class="center p2">THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY.</p>

<p>Beyond the Allegheny ranges, which are gradually
broken down into their lower foothills, and then to an
almost monotonous level, the expansive prairie lands
stretch towards the setting sun. From their prolific
agriculture has come much of the wealth and prosperity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>
of the United States. The rivers flowing out
of the mountains seek the Mississippi Valley, thus
reaching the sea through the Great Father of Waters.
Among these rivers is the Ohio, and at its confluence
with the Beaver, near the western border of Pennsylvania,
was, in the early days, the Revolutionary
outpost of Fort McIntosh, a defensive work against
the Indians. All about is a region of coal and gas,
extending across the boundary into the Mahoning district
of Ohio, the Mahoning River being an affluent
of the Beaver. Numerous railroads serve its many
towns of furnaces and forges. To the southward is
Steubenville on the Ohio, and to the northward
Youngstown on the Mahoning, both busy manufacturing
centres. Salem and Alliance are also prominent,
and some distance northwest is Canton, a city
of thirty thousand people, in a fertile grain district,
the home of President William McKinley. Massillon,
upon the pleasant Tuscarawas River, in one of the
most productive Ohio coal-fields, preserves the
memory of the noted French missionary priest,
Jean Baptiste Massillon, for all this region was first
traversed, and opened to civilization, by the French
religious explorers from Canada who went out to convert
the Indians.</p>

<p>In the centre of the State of Ohio is the capital,
Columbus, built on the banks of the Scioto River, a
tributary of the Ohio flowing southward and two
hundred miles long. This river receives the Olentangy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>
or Whetstone River at Columbus, in a region
of great fertility, which is in fact the characteristic
of the whole Scioto Valley. The Ohio capital, which
has a population of one hundred and twenty thousand,
large commerce and many important manufacturing
establishments, dates from 1812, and became the seat
of the State Government in 1816. The large expenditures
of public money upon numerous public institutions,
all having fine buildings, the wide, tree-shaded
streets, and the many attractive residences, have
made it one of the finest cities in the United States.
Broad Street, one hundred and twenty feet wide,
beautifully shaded with maples and elms, extends for
seven miles. The Capitol occupies a large park surrounded
with elms, and is an impressive Doric building
of gray limestone, three hundred and four feet
long and one hundred and eighty-four feet wide, the
rotunda being one hundred and fifty-seven feet high.
There are fine parks on the north, south and east of
the city, the latter containing the spacious grounds
of the Agricultural Society. Almost all the Ohio
State buildings, devoted to its benevolence, justice or
business, have been concentrated in Columbus, adding
to its attractions, and it is also the seat of the
Ohio State University with one thousand students.
Railroads radiate in all directions, adding to its commercial
importance.</p>

<p>In going westward, the region we are traversing
beyond the Pennsylvania boundary gradually changes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>
from coal and iron to a rich agricultural section. As
we move away from the influence of the Allegheny
ranges, the hills become gentler, and the rolling surface
is more and more subdued, until it is smoothed
out into an almost level prairie, heavily timbered
where not yet cleared for cultivation. This was the
Northwest Territory, first explored by the French,
who were led by the Sieur de la Salle in his original
discoveries in the seventeenth century. The French
held it until the conquest of Canada, when that Dominion
and the whole country west to the Mississippi
River came under the British flag by the treaty of
1763. After the Revolution, the various older Atlantic
seaboard States claiming the region, ceded sovereignty
to the United States Government, and then
its history was chequered by Indian wars until General
Wayne conducted an expedition against the
Miamis and defeated them in 1794, after which the
Northwest Territory was organized, and the State of
Ohio taken out of it and admitted to the Union in
1803, its first capital being Chillicothe. It was removed
to Zanesville for a couple of years, but finally
located at Columbus.</p>

<p>Beyond the Scioto the watershed is crossed, by
which the waters of the Ohio are left behind and the
valley of Sandusky River is reached, a tributary of
Lake Erie. Here is Bucyrus, in another prolific
natural gas region, the centre of which is Findlay.
At this town, in 1887, the inhabitants, who had then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
had just one year of natural gas development, spent
three days in exuberant festivity, to show their appreciation
of the wonderful discovery. They had
thirty-one gas wells pouring out ninety millions of
cubic feet in a day, all piped into town and feeding
thirty thousand glaring natural gas torches of enormous
power, which blew their roaring flames as an
accompaniment to the oratory of John Sherman and
Joseph B. Foraker, who were then respectively Senator
and Governor of Ohio. The soldiers and firemen
paraded, and a multitude of brass bands tried to
drown the Niagara of gas which was heard roaring
five miles away, while the country at night was illuminated
for twenty miles around. But the wells have
since diminished their flow, although the gas still exists;
while another field with a prolific yield is in
Fairfield County, a short distance southeast of Columbus.
Over the State boundary in Indiana is yet
another great gas-field covering five thousand square
miles in a dozen counties, with probably two thousand
wells and a yield which has reached three thousand
millions of cubic feet in a day. This gas supplies
many cities and towns, including Chicago, and it is
one of the greatest gas-fields known. In the same
region there are also large petroleum deposits.</p>

<p>Not far beyond the State boundary is Fort Wayne,
the leading city of Northern Indiana, having forty
thousand population, an important railway centre, and
prominent also in manufactures. It stands in a fertile
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>
agricultural district, and being located at the
highest part of the gentle elevation, beyond the Sandusky
Valley, diverting the waters east and west, it
is appropriately called the "Summit City." Here the
Maumee River is formed by the confluence of the
two streams St. Joseph and St. Mary, and flows
through the prairie towards the northeast, to make
the head of Lake Erie. The French, under La Salle,
in the eighteenth century established a fur-trading
post here, and erected Fort Miami, and in 1760 the
British penetrated to this then remote region and
also built a fort. During the Revolution this country
was abandoned to the Indians, but when General
Wayne defeated the Miamis in 1794 he thought the
place would make a good frontier outpost to hold the
savages in check, and he then constructed a strong
work, to which he gave the name of Fort Wayne.
Around this post the town afterwards grew, being
greatly prospered by the Wabash and Erie Canal,
and by the various railways subsequently constructed
in all directions. All this prairie region was the
hunting-ground of the Miamis, whose domain extended
westward to Lake Michigan, and southward
along the valley of the Miami River to the Ohio.
They were a warlike and powerful tribe, and their
adherence to the English during the Revolution provoked
almost constant hostilities with the settlers
who afterwards came across the mountains to colonize
the Northwest Territory. Under the leadership
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
of their renowned chief Mishekonequah, or the
"Little Turtle," they defeated repeated expeditions
sent against them, until finally beaten by Wayne.
Subsequently they dwindled in importance, and when
removed farther west, about 1848, they numbered
barely two hundred and fifty persons.</p>

<p class="center p2">OLD TIPPECANOE.</p>

<p>Some distance westward is the Tippecanoe River,
a stream flowing southwest into the Wabash, and
thence into the Ohio. The word Tippecanoe is said
to mean "the great clearing," and on this river was
fought the noted battle by "Old Tippecanoe," General
William Henry Harrison, against the combined
forces of the Shawnees, Miamis and several other
tribes, which resulted in their complete defeat. They
were united under Elskwatawa, or the "Prophet,"
the brother of the famous Tecumseh. These two
chieftains were Shawnees, and they preached a crusade
by which they gathered all the northwestern
tribes in a concerted movement to resist the steady
encroachments of the whites. The brother, who was
a "medicine man," in 1805 set up as an inspired
prophet, denouncing the use of liquors, and of all
food, manners and customs introduced by the hated
"palefaces," and confidently predicted they would
ultimately be driven from the land. For years both
chiefs travelled over the country stirring up the Indians.
General Harrison, who was the Governor of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
the Northwest Territory, gathered his forces together
and advanced up the Wabash against the Prophet's
town of Tippecanoe, when the Indians, hoping to
surprise him, suddenly attacked his camp, but he
being prepared, they were signally defeated, thus
giving Harrison his popular title of "Old Tippecanoe,"
which had much to do with electing him
President in 1840. Some time after this defeat the
War of 1812 broke out, when Tecumseh espoused the
English cause, went to Canada with his warriors, and
was made a brigadier-general. He was killed there
in the battle of the Thames, in Ontario Province,
and it is said had a premonition of death, for, laying
aside his general's uniform, he put on a hunting-dress
and fought desperately until he was slain. Tecumseh
was the most famous Indian chief of his time, and
the honor of killing him was claimed by several who
fought in the battle, so that the problem of "Who
killed Tecumseh?" was long discussed throughout the
country.</p>

<p>The State of Indiana was admitted into the Union
in 1816, and in its centre, built upon a broad plain,
on the east branch of White River, is its capital and
largest city, Indianapolis, having two hundred thousand
population. This is a great railway centre,
having lines radiating in all directions, and it also has
extensive manufactures and a large trade in live
stock. The city plan, with wide streets crossing at
right angles, and four diagonal avenues radiating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
from a circular central square, makes it very attractive;
and the residential quarter, displaying tasteful
houses, ornate grounds and shady streets, is regarded
as one of the most beautiful in the country. The
State Capitol, in a spacious park, is a Doric building
with colonnade, central tower and dome, and in an
enclosure on its eastern front is erected one of the
finest Soldiers' and Sailors' Monuments existing,
rising two hundred and eighty-five feet, out-topping
everything around, having been designed and largely
constructed in Europe. There are also many prominent
public buildings throughout the city. Indianapolis,
first settled in 1819, had but a small population
until the railways centred there, the Capitol being
removed from Corydon in 1825. The Wabash River,
to which reference has been made, receives White
River, and is one of the largest affluents of the Ohio,
about five hundred and fifty miles long, being navigable
over half that length. It rises in the State of
Ohio, flows across Indiana, and, turning southward,
makes for a long distance the Illinois boundary. Its
chief city is Terre Haute, the "High Ground,"
about seventy miles west of Indianapolis, another
prominent railroad centre, having forty-five thousand
people, with extensive manufactures. It is surrounded
by valuable coal-fields, is built upon an elevated
plateau, and, like all these prairie cities, is noted
for its many broad and well-shaded streets. It was
founded in 1816.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2">THE GREAT WEST.</p>

<p>Progressing westward, the timbered prairie gradually
changes to the grass-covered prairie, spreading
everywhere a great ocean of fertility. Across the
Wabash is the "Prairie State" of Illinois, its name
coming from its principal river, which the Indians
named after themselves. The word is a French
adaptation of the Indian name "Illini," meaning
"the superior men," the earliest explorers and settlers
having been French, the first comers on the
Illinois River being Father Marquette and La Salle.
At the beginning of the eighteenth century their
little settlements were flourishing, and the most glowing
accounts were sent home, describing the region,
which they called "New France," on account of its
beauty, attractiveness and prodigious fertility, as a
new Paradise. There were many years of Indian
conflicts and hostility, but after peace was restored
and a stable government established, population
flowed in, and Illinois was admitted as a State to the
Union in 1818. The capital was established at
Springfield in 1837, an attractive city of about thirty
thousand inhabitants, built on a prairie a few miles
south of Sangamon River, a tributary of the Illinois,
and from its floral development and the adornment of
its gardens and shade trees, Springfield is popularly
known as the "Flower City." There is a magnificent
State Capitol with high surmounting dome, patterned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>
somewhat after the Federal Capitol at Washington.
Springfield has coal-mines which add to its
prosperity, but its great fame is connected with Abraham
Lincoln. He lived in Springfield, and the house
he occupied when elected President has been acquired
by the State and is on public exhibition. After his
assassination in 1865, his remains were brought from
Washington to Springfield, and interred in the picturesque
Oak Ridge Cemetery, in the northern suburbs,
where a magnificent monument was erected to
his memory and dedicated in 1874. About sixty
miles north of Springfield, the Illinois River expands
into Peoria Lake, and here came La Salle down the
river in 1680, and at the foot of the lake established
a trading-post and fort, one of the earliest in that
region. When more than a century had elapsed, a
little town grew there which is now the busy industrial
city of Peoria, famous for its whiskey and glucose,
and turning out products that annually approximate
a hundred millions, furnishing vast traffic for
numerous railroads. It is the chief city of the "corn
belt," and is served by all the prominent trunk railway
lines.</p>

<p>Like the pioneers of a hundred years ago, we have
left the Atlantic seaboard, crossed the Allegheny
Mountains and entered the expansive "Northwest
Territory," which in the first half of the nineteenth
century was the Mecca of the colonist and frontiersman.
This was then the region of the "Great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>
West," though that has since moved far beyond the
Mississippi. Its agricultural wealth made the prosperity
of the country for many decades, and its prodigious
development was hardly realized until put to
the test of the Civil War, when it poured out the
men and officers, and had the staying qualities so
largely contributing to the result of that great conflict.
Gradually overspread by a network of railways,
the numerous "cross-roads" have expanded everywhere
into towns and cities, almost all patterned
alike, and all of them centres of rich farming districts.
Coal, oil and gas have come to minister to its
manufacturing wants, and thus growing into mature
Commonwealths, this prolific region in the later decades
has been itself, in turn, contributing largely to
the tide of migration flowing to the present "Great
Northwest," a thousand miles or more beyond. It
presents a rich agricultural picture, but little scenic
attractiveness. Everywhere an almost dead level,
the numerous railways cross and recross the surface
in all directions at grade, and are easily built, it being
only necessary to dig a shallow ditch on either side,
throw the earth in the centre, and lay the ties and
rails. Nature has made the prairie as smooth as a
lake, so that hardly any grading is necessary, and the
region of expansive green viewed out of the car
window has been aptly described as having "a face
but no features," when one looks afar over an ocean
of waving verdure.

<p class="center p2">LAKE ERIE.</p>

<p>This vast prairie extends northward to and beyond
the Great Lakes, and it is recorded that in the early
history of the proposed legislation for the "Northwest
Territory," Congress gravely selected as the
names of the States which were to be created out of
it such ponderous conglomerates as "Metropotamia,"
"Assenispia," "Pelisipia" and "Polypotamia," titles
which happily were long ago permitted to pass into
oblivion. Northward, in Ohio, the region stretches
to Lake Erie, the most southern and the smallest of
the group of Great Lakes above Niagara. It is regarded
as the least attractive lake, having neither
romances nor much scenery. Yet, from its favorable
position, it carries an enormous commerce. It is
elliptical in form, about two hundred and forty miles
long and sixty miles broad, the surface being five
hundred and sixty-five feet above the ocean level.
It is a very shallow lake, the depth rarely exceeding
one hundred and twenty feet, excepting at the lower
end, while the other lakes are much deeper, and in
describing this difference of level it is said that the
surplus waters poured from the vast <i>basins</i> of Superior,
Michigan and Huron, flow across the <i>plate</i> of
Erie into the deep <i>bowl</i> of Ontario. This shallowness
causes it to be easily disturbed, so that it is the
most dangerous of these fresh-water seas, and it has
few harbors, and those very poor, especially upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>
southern shore. The bottom of the lake is a light,
clayey sediment, rapidly accumulated from the wearing
away of the shores, largely composed of clay
strata. The loosely-aggregated products of these disintegrated
strata are frequently seen along its coast,
forming cliffs extending back into elevated plateaus,
through which the rivers cut deep channels. Their
mouths are clogged by sand-bars, and dredging and
breakwaters have made the harbors on the southern
shore, around which have grown the chief towns&mdash;Dunkirk,
Erie, Ashtabula, Cleveland, Sandusky and
Toledo. The name of Lake Erie comes from the
Indian "tribe of the Cat," whom the French called
the "Chats," because their early explorers, penetrating
to the shores of the lake, found them abounding
in wild cats, and thus they gave the same name to
the cats and the savages. In their own parlance,
these Indians were the "Eries," and in the seventeenth
century they numbered about two thousand
warriors. In 1656 the Iroquois attacked and almost
annihilated them.</p>

<p>The Lake Erie ports in the "Buckeye State" of
Ohio, so called from the buckeye tree, are chiefly
harbors for shipping coal and receiving ores from the
upper lakes, their railroads leading to the great industrial
centres to the southward. Near the eastern
boundary of Ohio is Conneaut, on the bank of a wide
and deep ravine, formed by a small river, broadening
into a bay at the shore of the lake, the name meaning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>
"many fish." Here landed in 1796 the first settlers
from Connecticut, who entered the "Western
Reserve," as all this region was then called. On July
4th of that year, celebrating the national anniversary,
"they pledged each other in tin cups of lake
water, accompanied by a salute of fowling-pieces,"
and the next day began building the first house on
the Reserve, constructed of logs, and long known as
"Stow Castle." Conneaut is consequently known as
the "Plymouth of the Western Reserve," as here
began the settlements made by the Puritan New England
migration to Ohio. On deep ravines making
their harbors are Ashtabula, an enormous <i>entrepôt</i> for
ores, and a few miles farther westward, Painesville,
on Grand River, named for Thomas Paine. Beyond
is Mentor, the home of the martyred President Garfield,
whose large white house stands near the railway.
All along here, the southern shore of Lake Erie
is a broad terrace at eighty to one hundred feet elevation
above the water, while farther inland is another
and considerably higher plateau. Each sharp declivity
facing northward seems at one time to have
been the actual shore of the lake when its surface
before the waters receded was much higher than
now. The outer plateau having once been the
overflowed lake bed, is level, excepting where the
crooked but attractive streams have deeply cut
their winding ravines down through it to reach Lake
Erie.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2">THE CITY OF CLEVELAND.</p>

<p>Thus we come to Cleveland, the second city in
Ohio, having four hundred thousand people, and extensive
manufacturing industries. It is the capital
of the "Western Reserve" and the chief city of
Northern Ohio, its commanding position upon a high
bluff, falling off precipitously to the edge of the
water, giving it the most attractive situation on the
shore of Lake Erie. Shade trees embower it, including
many elms planted by the early settlers, who
learned to love them in New England, and hence it
delights in the popular title of the "Forest City."
Were not the streets so wide, the profusion of foliage
might make Cleveland seem like a town in the woods.
The little Cuyahoga River, its name meaning "the
crooked stream," flows with wayward course down a
deeply washed and winding ravine, making a valley
in the centre of the city, known as "the Flats," and
this, with the tributary ravines of some smaller
streams, is packed with factories and foundries, oil refineries
and lumber mills, their chimneys keeping the
business section constantly under a cloud of smoke.
Railways run in all directions over these flats and
through the ravines, while, high above, the city has
built a stone viaduct nearly a half-mile long, crossing
the valley. Here are the great works of the Standard
Oil Company, controlling that trade, and several of
the petroleum magnates have their palaces in the city.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span></p>

<p>Old Moses Cleaveland, a shrewd but unsatisfied
Puritan of the town of Windham, Connecticut, became
the agent of the Connecticut Lead Company,
who brought out the first colony in 1796 that landed
at Conneaut. They explored the lake shore, and
selecting as a good location the mouth of Cuyahoga
River, Moses wrote back to his former home that
they had found a spot "on the bank of Lake Erie
which was called by my name, and I believe the
child is now born that may live to see that place as
large as old Windham." In little over a century the
town has grown far beyond his wildest dreams, although
it did not begin to expand until the era of
canals and railways, and it was not so long ago that
the people in grateful memory erected a bronze statue
of the founder. One of the local antiquaries, delving
into the records, has found why various original
settlers made their homes at Cleveland. He learned
that "one man, on his way farther West, was laid up
with the ague and had to stop; another ran out of
money and could get no farther; another had been
to St. Louis and wanted to get back home, but saw a
chance to make money in ferrying people across the
river; another had $200 over, and started a bank;
while yet another thought he could make a living by
manufacturing ox-yokes, and he stayed." This
earnest investigator continues: "A man with an
agricultural eye would look at the soil and kick his
toe into it, and then would shake his head and declare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>
that it would not grow white beans&mdash;but he
knew not what this soil would bring forth; his hope
and trust was in beans, he wanted to know them
more, and wanted potatoes, corn, oats and cabbage,
and he knew not the future of Euclid Avenue."</p>

<p>On either side of the deep valley of "the Flats"
stretch upon the plateau the long avenues of Cleveland,
with miles of pleasant residences, surrounded
by lawns and gardens, each house isolated in green,
and the whole appearing like a vast rural village
more than a city. This pleasant plan of construction
had its origin in the New England ideas of the
people. Yet the city also has a numerous population
of Germans, and it is recorded that one of the early
landowners wrote, in explaining his project of settlement:
"If I make the contract for thirty thousand
acres, I expect with all speed to send you fifteen or
twenty families of prancing Dutchmen." These
Teutons came and multiplied, for the original Puritan
stock can hardly be responsible for the vineyards of
the neighborhood, the music and dancing, and the
public gardens along the pleasant lake shore, where
the crowds go, when work is over, to enjoy recreation
and watch the gorgeous summer sunsets across the
bosom of the lake which are the glory of Cleveland.
Upon the plateau, the centre of the city, is the Monumental
Park, where stand the statue of Moses Cleaveland,
the founder, who died in 1806, and a fine
Soldiers' Monument, with also a statue of Commodore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>
Perry. This Park is an attractive enclosure of about
ten acres, having fountains, gardens, monuments and
a little lake, and it is intersected at right angles by
two broad streets, and surrounded by important
buildings. One of the streets is the chief business
highway, Superior Street, and the other leads down
to the edge of the bluff on the lake shore, where the
steep slope is made into a pleasure-ground, with more
flower-beds and fountains and a pleasant outlook over
the water, although at its immediate base is a labyrinth
of railroads and an ample supply of smoke from
the numerous locomotives. A long breakwater protects
the harbor entrance, and out under the lake is
bored the water-works tunnel.</p>

<p>There extends far to the eastward, from a corner
of the Monumental Park, Cleveland's famous street&mdash;Euclid
Avenue. The people regard it as the handsomest
highway in America, in the combined magnificence
of houses and grounds. It is a level avenue
of about one hundred and fifty feet width, with
a central roadway and stone footwalks on either hand,
shaded by rows of grand overarching elms, and bordered
on both sides by well-kept lawns. This is the
public highway, every part being kept scrupulously
neat, while a light railing marks the boundary between
the street and the private grounds. For a
long distance this noble avenue is bordered by stately
residences, each surrounded by ample gardens, the
stretch of grass, flowers and foliage extending back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span>
from one hundred to four hundred feet between the
street and the buildings. Embowered in trees, and
with all the delights of garden and lawn seen in every
direction, this grand avenue makes a delightful driveway
and promenade. Upon it live the multi-millionaires
of Cleveland, the finest residences being
upon the northern side, where they have invested
part of the profits of their railways, mills, mines, oil
wells and refineries in adorning their homes and ornamenting
their city. This splendid boulevard, in one
way, is a reproduction of the Parisian Avenue of the
Champs Elysées and its gardens, but with more attractions
in the surroundings of its bordering rows
of palaces. Here live the men who vie with those of
Chicago in controlling the commerce of the lakes and
the affairs of the Northwest. Plenty of room and an
abundance of income are necessary to provide each
man, in the heart of the city, with two to ten acres
of lawns and gardens around his house, but it is done
here with eminent success. About four miles out is
the beautiful Wade Park, opposite which are the
handsome buildings of the Western Reserve University,
having, with its adjunct institutions, a thousand
students. Beyond this, the avenue ends at the
attractive Lake View Cemetery, where, on the
highest part of the elevated plateau, with a grand
outlook over Lake Erie, is the grave of the assassinated
President Garfield. His imposing memorial
rises to a height of one hundred and sixty-five feet.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2">CLEVELAND TO CHICAGO.</p>

<p>Thirty-five miles southwest of Cleveland, and
some distance inland from Lake Erie, is Oberlin,
where, in a fertile and prosperous district, is the
leading educational foundation of Northern Ohio&mdash;Oberlin
College&mdash;named in memory of the noted
French philanthropist, and established in 1833 by
the descendants of the Puritan colonists, to carry out
their idea of thorough equality in education. It admits
students without distinction of sex or color, and
has about thirteen hundred, almost equally divided
between the sexes, occupying a cluster of commodious
buildings. To the westward is the beautiful
ravine of Black River, which gets out to the lake by
falling over a rocky ledge in two streams, and on the
peninsula formed by its forks is the town of Elyria.
Maria Ely was the wife of the founder of the settlement,
who named it after her in this peculiar reversible
way. This romantic stream bounds the
"Fire Lands" of the Western Reserve, a tract of
nearly eight hundred square miles abutting on the
lake shore, which Connecticut set apart for colonization
by her people, who had been sufferers from destructive
fires in the towns of New London, Fairfield
and Norwalk on Long Island Sound. They secured
this wilderness in the early part of the nineteenth
century, and their chief town is Sandusky, with
twenty-five thousand population. Here lived most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span>
of the Eries, the Indian "tribe of the Cat," who
fished in Sandusky Bay, its upper waters being an
archipelago of little green islands abounding with
water fowl. They were known to the adjoining
tribes as the "Neutral Nation," for they maintained
two villages of refuge on Sandusky River, between
the warlike Indians of the east and the west, and
whoever entered their boundaries was safe from pursuit,
the sanctuary being rigidly observed. The
early French missionaries who found them in the
seventeenth century speak of these anomalous villages
among the savages as having then been long
in existence.</p>

<p>The name of Sandusky is a corruption of a Wyandot
word meaning "cold-water pools," the French
having originally rendered it as Sandosquet. The
shores are low, but there is a good harbor and much
trade, and here is located the Ohio State Fish
Hatchery. The railroads are laid among the savannahs
and lagoons, and one of the suburban stations
has been not inaptly named Venice. There are extensive
vineyards on the flat and sunny shores of the
bay, and this is one of the most prolific grape districts
in the State. Sandusky Bay is a broad sheet
of water, in places six miles wide, and about twenty
miles long. Sandusky has a large timber trade,
being noted for the manufacture of hard woods. Out
beyond the bold peninsula, protruding into the lake
at the entrance to the bay, is a group of islands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span>
spreading over the southwestern waters of Lake
Erie, of which Kelly's Island is the chief, an archipelago
formed largely from the <i>detritus</i> washed out
of the Detroit, Maumee and various other rivers
flowing into the head of the lake. Here the Erie
Indians had a fortified stronghold, whose outlines can
still be traced. The most noted of the group is Put-in-Bay
Island, now a popular watering-place, which
got its name from Commodore Perry, who "put in"
there with the captured British fleet at the naval
battle of Lake Erie, September 10, 1813. It was
from this place, just after his victory, that he sent the
historic despatch, giving him fame, "We have met
the enemy and they are ours." The killed of both
fleets were buried side by side near the beach on the
island, the place being marked by a mound. The
lovely sheet of water of Put-in-Bay glistens in front,
having the towns of villa-crowned Gibraltar Island
upon its surface. Vineyards and roses abound, these
islands, like the adjacent shores, being noted for their
wines.</p>

<p>The Maumee River, coming up from Fort Wayne,
flows into the head of Lake Erie, the largest stream
on its southern coast. It comes from the southwest
through the region of the "Black Swamp," a vast
district, originally morass and forest, which has been
drained to make a most fertile country. This "miserable
bog," as the original settlers denounced it,
when they were jolted over the rude corduroy roads
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span>
that sustained them upon the quaking morass, has
since become the "prolific garden" and "magnificent
forest" described by the modern tourist. The Maumee
Valley was an almost continual battle-ground
with the Indians when "Mad Anthony Wayne"
commanded on that frontier, he being called by them
the "Wind," because "he drives and tears everything
before him." For a quarter of a century
border warfare raged along this river, then known
as the "Miami of the Lakes," and its chief settlement,
Toledo, passed its infancy in a baptism of blood
and fire. It was at the battle of Fallen Timbers,
fought in 1794, almost on the site of Toledo, that
Wayne gave his laconic and noted "field orders."
General William Henry Harrison, then his aide, told
Wayne just before the battle he was afraid he would
get into the fight and forget to give "the necessary
field orders." Wayne replied: "Perhaps I may, and
if I do, recollect that the standing order for the day
is, charge the rascals with the bayonets." Toledo
is built on the flat surface on both sides of the Maumee
River and Bay, which make it a good harbor,
stretching six miles down to Lake Erie. There are
a hundred thousand population here, and this energetic
reproduction of the ancient Spanish city has
named its chief newspaper the <i>Toledo Blade</i>. The
city has extensive railway connections and a large
trade in lumber and grain, coal and ores, and does
much manufacturing, it being well served with natural
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">425</a></span>
gas. A dozen grain elevators line the river
banks, and the factory smokes overhang the broad
low-lying city like a pall. To the westward, crossing
the rich lands of the reclaimed swamp, is the Indiana
boundary, that State being here a broad and
level prairie, which also stretches northward into
Michigan. The chief town of Northern Indiana is
South Bend, named from the sweeping southern bend
of St. Joseph River, on which it is built. This stream
rises in Michigan, and flows for two hundred and fifty
miles over the prairie, going down into Indiana and
then back again to empty into Lake Michigan. South
Bend is noted for its carriage- and wagon-building
factories, and has several flourishing Roman Catholic
institutions, generally of French origin. To the
westward spreads the level prairie, with scant scenic
attractions, though rich in agriculture, to the shores
of Lake Michigan, being gridironed with railways as
Chicago is approached.</p>

<p class="center p2">THE GREAT CITY OF THE LAKES.</p>

<p>The second city in the United States, with a population
approximating two millions, Chicago, the metropolis
of the prairies, seems destined for unlimited
growth. It has absorbed all the outlying towns, and
now embraces nearly two hundred square miles. It
has a water-front on Lake Michigan of twenty-six
miles, and its trade constantly grows. It pushes
ahead with boundless energy, attracting the shrewdest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span>
men of the West to take part in its vast and
profitable enterprises, and is in such a complete manner
the depot and storehouse for the products and
supplies of goods for the enormous prairie region
around it, and for the entire Northwest, and the
country out to the Rocky Mountains and Pacific
Ocean, that other Western cities cannot displace or
even hope to rival it. Yet it is a youthful giant, of
quick and marvellous development, but few of its
leading spirits having been born within its limits,
nearly all being attracted thither by its paramount
advantages. The prominent characteristics of Chicago
are an overhanging pall of smoke; streets
crowded with quick-moving, busy people; a vast aggregation
of railways, vessels, elevators and traffic
of all kinds; a polyglot population drawn from almost
all races; and an earnest devotion to the almighty
dollar. Its name came from the river, and is of Indian
origin, regarded as probably a corruption of
"Cheecagua," the title of a dynasty of chiefs who
controlled the country west and south of Lake Michigan.
This also was a word applied in the Indian
dialect to the wild onion growing luxuriantly on
the banks of the river, and they gave a similar
name to the thunder which they believed the voice
of the Great Spirit, and to the odorous animal
abounding in the neighborhood that the white man
knew as the "polecat." These were rather incongruous
uses for the same word, but the suggestion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span>
has been made that all can be harmonized if Chicago
is interpreted as meaning "strong," the Indians,
being poorly supplied with words, usually selecting
the most prominent attribute in giving names. All
these things are in one way or another "strong,"
and it is evident that prodigious strength exists in
Chicago.</p>

<p>As elsewhere throughout the Northwest, the French
missionaries were here the earliest explorers, Father
Marquette coming in 1673, and afterwards Hennepin,
Joliet and La Salle, whose names are so numerously
reproduced in the Northwestern States. The French
built at the mouth of the river Fort Chicagou, for a
trading-post, and held it until the English conquered
Canada. When the earlier American settlers ventured
to this frontier, the Indians on Lake Michigan
were the Pottawatomies, and were hostile. The
Government in 1804 built Fort Dearborn, near the
mouth of the Chicago River, to control them. These
Indians joined in the crusade of the Prophet and
Tecumseh, and when the war with England began in
1812, attacked and captured the fort, massacring
the garrison. The post was subsequently re-established,
and the Indians were ultimately removed west
of the Mississippi. Not long afterwards it was said
the first purchase of the site of Chicago took place,
wherein a large part of the land now occupied was
sold for a pair of boots. When the town plot was
originally surveyed, twelve families were there in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span>
addition to the garrison of Fort Dearborn, and in
1831 it had one hundred people. In 1833 the town
government was organized, and it had five hundred
and fifty inhabitants and one hundred and seventy-five
buildings. Five trustees then ruled Chicago, and
collected $49 for the first year's taxes. Collis P.
Huntington, the Pacific Railway manager, says that
in 1835, being possessed of a good constitution and
a pair of mules, but little else, he was out that way
prospecting, and found at Chicago nothing but a
swamp and a few destitute farmers, all anxious to
move. One of these farmers came to him with the
deed of his farm of two thousand acres, and offered
to trade it for his pair of mules. Huntington adds:
"I was not very favorably impressed with the settlement
and declined his offer, and finally continued my
travel west, and that farm is to-day the business
centre of Chicago."</p>

<p>In 1837 Chicago got its first city charter, and it
then had about forty-two hundred people. The rapid
growth since has been unparalleled, especially when,
after 1850, its commercial enterprise began attracting
wide attention, the population then being about
thirty thousand. In 1855, to get above the swamp
and improve the drainage, the level of the entire city
was raised seven feet, huge buildings being elevated
bodily while business was progressing, an enterprise
mainly accomplished by the ingenious devices which
first gave prominence to the late George M. Pullman.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">429</a></span>
The population almost quadrupled and its trade increased
tenfold in the decade 1850-60, and in 1870
the population was over three hundred thousand, and
it had become a leading American city. Yet Chicago
has had terrible setbacks in its wonderful career, the
most awful being the fire in October, 1871, the
greatest of modern times, which raged for three days,
burned over a surface of nearly four square miles
and until practically nothing remained in the district
to devour, destroyed eighteen thousand buildings, two
hundred lives, and property valued at $200,000,000,
leaving a hundred thousand people homeless&mdash;a
calamity that excited the sympathies of the world,
which gave relief contributions aggregating $7,000,000.
Yet while the embers were smoking, this enterprising
people set to work to rebuild their city
with a will and a progress which caused almost as
much amazement as the original catastrophe. The
recovery was complete; the city which had been of
wood was rebuilt of brick and stone and iron and
steel, and its progress since has developed an energy
not before equalled. It has been beautified by grand
parks and boulevards, and by the construction of
palatial residences and business blocks, and of enormous
office buildings, the tall "sky-scrapers" having
been first invented and built in Chicago. In 1893
the World's Columbian Exhibition, to celebrate the
discovery of America, was held at Chicago on a vast
scale and with remarkable success. The city has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">430</a></span>
long been, also, a favorite meeting-place for the great
political Conventions nominating candidates for President
and Vice-President of the United States, its
large hotel capacity and immense halls giving advantages
for these enormous assemblages.</p>

<p class="center p2">CHICAGO'S ADMIRABLE LOCATION.</p>

<p>The position of Chicago at the southwestern extremity
of Lake Michigan, with prairies of the
greatest fertility stretching hundreds of miles south
and west, makes the city the primary food-gatherer
and supply-distributor of the great Northwest, and
this has been the chief cause of its growth. In September,
1833, the Pottawatomies agreed to sell their
prairie homes to the United States and migrate to
reservations farther West, and seven thousand of
them assembled in grand council at Chicago, and sold
the Government twenty millions of acres of these
prairies around Lake Michigan, in Indiana, Illinois
and Michigan, for $1,100,000. Thus was this fertile
domain opened to settlement. In the Indian dialect,
Michigan means the "great water," and it is the
largest lake within the United States, being three
hundred and twenty miles long and seventy broad,
and having an average depth of one thousand feet,
with the surface elevated five hundred and seventy-eight
feet above the ocean level. On the Chicago
side this extensive lake has but a narrow watershed,
the Illinois River, draining the region to the westward,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">431</a></span>
being formed only sixty-five miles southwest
of the lake by the junction of the Kankakee and
Desplaines Rivers. This narrow and very low watershed,
considered in connection with the enormous
capacity of the Illinois River valley, which is at a
much lower level and appears as if worn by a mighty
current in former times, is regarded by geologists as
an evidence of the probability that the Lake Michigan
waters may in past ages have found their way to
that outlet and flowed through the Illinois and Mississippi
Rivers to the Gulf. The diminutive bayou
of the Chicago River, with its two short and tortuous
branches, made Chicago the leading lake port, and
thus brought trade, so that early in the race it far
outstripped all its Western rivals. Every railroad of
prominence sought an outlet or a feeder at Chicago,
and the title of a "trunk line" was adopted for a
line of rails between Chicago and the seaboard. The
surrounding prairie for miles is crossed in all directions
by railways, and a large part of the city and
suburbs is made up of huge stations, car-yards, elevators,
storehouses and cattle-pens, almost overwhelming
visitors with the prodigious scale of
their elaborate perplexity. The maze of railways
and streets on the level surface, all crossing at grade,
as it has spread over miles of prairie and grown into
such enormous proportions, presents a most serious
problem, with which the city and the railways are
now dealing on a comprehensive plan, by which it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">432</a></span>
hoped that before long the grade-crossings will be
eliminated.</p>

<p>Another problem, found even more serious as the
city grew, was the drainage. In former years the
sewage was discharged into the Chicago River and
Lake Michigan. The river became a most malodorous
stream in consequence, and as it had practically
no descent, the current would scarcely flow, and the
lake, from which the city water-supply was drawn,
was more and more polluted. With the customary
enterprise of these wonderful people, however, they
decided to make the only change feasible, which was
to take advantage of the descending watershed towards
Desplaines River and change their sewerage
system so that it would all discharge in that direction.
The problem was solved by the construction of the
most expensive drainage works in the world, and a
complete change of the sewers, at a cost altogether
approximating $40,000,000. St. Louis and the towns
along the Desplaines fought the scheme, and there
was protracted litigation, but the very existence of
Chicago depended on the result. The great drainage
canal was completed connecting the Chicago River
South Branch with Desplaines River at Lockport,
twenty-eight miles southwest, where it discharges the
outflow from Lake Michigan, which then flows past
Joliet, and ultimately into Illinois River. This huge
canal, opened in January, 1900, reverses the flow of
the Chicago River, which now draws in about three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">433</a></span>
hundred thousand cubic feet of water per minute from
Lake Michigan and flushes the canal, which is also to
be made available for shipping. Thus the Chicago
River flows towards its source with a free current,
and Lake Michigan has been purified. The canal has
quite a descent to Lockport, and the water-power is
to be availed of in generating electricity. The city
water-supply is drawn from cribs out in the lake
through four systems of tunnels, aggregating twenty-two
miles, furnishing an ample service, and pumping-stations
in various locations elevate the water in
towers to secure sufficient head for the flow into the
buildings. The chief of these towers, a solid stone
structure alongside the lake, rises one hundred and
sixty feet, the huge pumping-engines forcing a vast
stream constantly over its top.</p>

<p class="center p2">FEATURES OF CHICAGO.</p>

<p>Chicago is the world's greatest grain, lumber and
cattle market. It attracts immigrants from everywhere,
and all flourish in native luxuriance, although
occasionally they are compelled to bow to the power
of the law by the military arm when civil forces are
exhausted. Everything seems to go on without
much hindrance, and thus this wonderful city secures
its rapid growth and completely cosmopolitan character.
While proud of their amazing progress, the
people seem generally so engrossed in pushing business
enterprises and piling up fortunes that they have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">434</a></span>
little time to think of much else. Yet somebody has
had opportunity to plan the adornment of the city by
a magnificent series of parks and boulevards encircling
it. The broad expanse of prairie was low,
level and treeless originally, but abundant trees have
since been planted, and art has made little lakes and
miniature hills, beautiful flower-gardens and abundant
shrubbery, thus producing pleasure-grounds of
rare attractions. Michigan Avenue and Drexel and
Grand Boulevards, leading to the southern system of
parks and Lake Shore Drive on the north side of
Chicago River, are the finest residential streets. The
huge Auditorium fronting on Michigan Avenue was
erected at a cost of $3,500,000, includes a hotel and
theatre, and is surmounted with a tower rising two
hundred and seventy feet, giving a fine view over
the city and lake. Out in front is the Lake Park,
with railways beyond near the shore, and a fine
bronze equestrian statue of General John A. Logan,
who died in 1886 and is buried in the crypt beneath
the monument. Michigan Avenue begins at Chicago
River alongside the site of old Fort Dearborn, now
obliterated, and it stretches far south, a tree-lined
boulevard adorned by magnificent residences.</p>

<p>Chicago River, with its entrance protected by a
wide-spreading breakwater, is the harbor of the city,
and, like its railways, carries the trade. Tunnels conduct
various streets under it, and a multitude of
bridges go over it, all of them opening to let vessels
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">435</a></span>
pass. They are mostly swinging bridges, but some
are ingenious constructions, which roll, and lift and
fold, and in various curious ways open the channel for
the shipping. Huge elevators line the river banks,
with vessels alongside, into which streams of grain
are poured, while multitudes of cars move in and out,
under and around them, bringing the supply from the
farm to the storage-bins. In the business section, as
elsewhere, the streets are wide, thus accommodating
the throngs who fill them, and there are fine city and
national buildings, a new Post-office of large size and
imposing architecture being in course of construction.
The Chicago Public Library, completed in 1897, is
a grand structure, costing $2,000,000, and having
about three hundred thousand volumes. The University
of Chicago, in the southern suburbs, is destined
to become one of the leading institutions of
learning in America. It began instruction in 1892,
and now has some twenty-four hundred students, and
endowments of $15,000,000, largely the gifts of
John D. Rockefeller. The University grounds cover
twenty-four acres, and when the plan is completed
there will be over forty buildings. Its libraries contain
three hundred and fifty thousand volumes. The
great Yerkes Observatory, adjunct to this University,
is at Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, seventy miles
distant, and has the largest refracting telescope in
the world, with forty-inch lens and a tube seventy
feet long. On the northern side of the city is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">436</a></span>
Newberry Library, with $3,000,000 endowment and
two hundred thousand volumes, including admirable
musical and medical collections, and the Crerar Library,
with $2,000,000 endowment, principally for
scientific works, is being established on the south
side. Chicago's greatest industrial establishment is
the Federal Steel Company, having enormous rolling-mills
and foundries in various parts of the city, and
also at Joliet on Desplaines River. Its South Chicago
Rolling Mills occupy over three hundred acres.
The manufacture of agricultural machinery is represented
by two enormous establishments, the McCormick
Harvesting Machine Company on the southwest
side and the Deering Works in the northwestern district.</p>

<p class="center p2">CHICAGO BUSINESS ENERGY.</p>

<p>As the elevators of Chicago represent its traffic in
grain, and contain usually a large proportion of what
is known as the "visible supply," so do the vast
lumber-yards along Chicago River often store up an
enormous product of the output from the "Great
North Woods," covering much of Michigan, Wisconsin
and Minnesota, and spreading across the Canadian
border. The third great branch of traffic is represented
by the Union Stock Yards in the southwestern
suburbs. These yards in a year will handle eight
millions of hogs, four millions of cattle, four millions
of sheep and a hundred thousand horses, over two-thirds
of the hogs and cattle being killed in the yards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">437</a></span>
and sent away in the form of meat, and the whole
annual traffic being valued at $250,000,000. The
yards cover three hundred acres, and with the packing-houses
employ twenty-five thousand men, and
they have twenty miles of water-troughs and twenty-five
miles of feeding-troughs, and are served by two
hundred and fifty miles of railway-tracks. The hog
is a potential factor in American economy, being regarded
as the most compact form in which the corn
crop of the country can be transported to market.
The corn on the farm is fed to the hog, and the animal
is sent to Chicago as a package provided by nature
for its economical utilization. The Union Stock
Yards make a complete town, with its own banks,
hotels, Board of Trade, Post-office, town-hall, newspaper
and special Fire Department. The extensive
enclosure is entered by a modest, gray sandstone turreted
gateway, surmounted by a carved bull's head,
emblematic of its uses. The Horse Market is a large
pavilion, seating four thousand people. From this
vast emporium, with its enormous packing-houses,
are sent away the meat supplies that go all over the
world, the product being carried out in long trains of
canned goods and refrigerator cars, the most ingenious
methods of "cold storage" being invented for
and used in this widely extended industry.</p>

<p>The active traffic of the grain and provision trades
of Chicago is conducted in the building of the Board
of Trade, a tall and imposing structure at the head
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">438</a></span>
of La Salle Street, which makes a fitting close to the
view along that grand highway. It is one of the
most elaborate architectural ornaments of the city,
and its surmounting tower rises three hundred and
twenty-two feet from the pavement. The fame of
this grand speculative arena is world-wide, and the
animated and at times most exciting business done
within marks the nervous beating of the pulse of this
metropolis of food products. The interior is a magnificent
hall, lighted by high-reaching windows and
surmounted by a central skylight elevated nearly a
hundred feet above the floor. Impressive columns
adorn the sides, and the elaborate frescoes above are
in keeping with its artistic decoration. Upon the
spacious floor, between nine and one o'clock, assemble
the wheat and corn, and pork, lard, cattle and railway
kings in a typical scene of concentrated and
boiling energy feeding the furnace in which Chicago's
high-pressure business enterprise glows and roars.
These speculative gladiators have their respective
"pits" or amphitheatres upon the floor, so that they
gather in huge groups, around which hundreds run
and jostle, the scene from the overlooking gallery, as
the crowds sway and squirm, and with their calls and
shouting make a deafening uproar, being a veritable
Bedlam. Each "pit" deals in a specific article, while
in another space are detachments of telegraph operators
working with nimble fingers to send instant reports
of the doings and prices to the anxious outer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">439</a></span>
world. High up on the side of the grand hall, in full
view of all, are hung large dials, whose moving hands
keep momentary record of the changes in prices
made by the noisy and excited throngs in the "pits,"
thus giving notice of the ruling figures for the next
month's "options" on wheat, corn and "short-ribs."
There are tables for samples, and large blackboards
bearing the figures of market quotations elsewhere.
This Chicago Board of Trade has been the scene of
some of the wildest speculative excitements in the
country, as its shouting and almost frenzied groups of
traders in the "pits" may make or break a "corner,"
and here in fitful fever concentrates the business
energy of the great Metropolis of the Lakes.</p>

<p class="center p2">PULLMAN AND THE SLEEPING-CAR.</p>

<p>Another Chicago specialty of wide fame is the
railway sleeping-car, brought to its present high
stage of development by one of the most prominent
Chicagoans, the late George M. Pullman. The
earliest American sleeping-car was devised by Theodore
T. Woodruff, who constructed a small working
model in 1854 at Watertown, New York, and subsequently
building his car, first ran it on the New
York Central Railroad in October, 1856, charging
fifty cents for a berth. George M. Pullman was
originally a cabinet-maker in New York State, and
moved when a young man to Chicago. His first
fame in that city, as already stated, came from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">440</a></span>
ingenious methods he devised, when the grade of the
town was elevated to secure better drainage, for raising
the buildings by putting hundreds of jackscrews
under them, trade continuing uninterrupted during
the process. Pullman, subsequently to that time,
travelled occasionally between Chicago and Buffalo,
and one night got into Woodruff's car. He was
stretched out upon the vibrating couch for some two
hours, but could not sleep, and his eyes being widely
open, and the sight wandering all about the car, he
struck upon a new idea. When he left the car he
had determined to develop from his brief experience
a plan destined to expand into a complete home upon
wheels for the traveller, either awake or sleeping.
In 1859 he turned two ordinary railway coaches into
sleeping-cars and placed them upon night trains between
Chicago and St. Louis, charging fifty cents per
berth, his first night's receipts being two dollars. He
ran these experimental coaches about five years before
he felt able to carry out his ideal plan, and he
then occupied fully a year in constructing his model
sleeping-car, the "Pioneer," at Chicago, at a cost of
$18,000. But when completed the car was so heavy,
wide and high that no railway could undertake running
it, as it necessitated cutting off station platforms
and elevating the tops of bridges before it could pass
by. Thus he had a white elephant on his hands for
a time. In April, 1865, President Lincoln's assassination
shocked the country, and the funeral, with its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">441</a></span>
escort of mourning statesmen, was progressing from
Washington to Chicago, on the way to the grave at
Springfield. The nation watched its progress, and
the railways transporting the <i>cortége</i> were doing their
best. The manager of the road from Chicago to
Springfield used the "Pioneer" in the funeral train,
taking several days to prepare for it by sending out
gangs of men to cut off the station platforms and
alter the bridges. Pullman's dream was realized;
his "coach of the future," with its escort of statesmen,
carried the dead President to his grave and became
noted throughout the land. A few weeks later, General
Grant, fresh from the conquest of the Rebellion,
had a triumphal progress from the camp to his home
in Illinois. Five days were spent in clearing the
railway between Detroit and Galena, where he lived,
and the "Pioneer" carried Grant over that line.</p>

<p>These successes made Pullman's fortune, and the
business of his company grew rapidly afterwards, it
being now an enormous concern with $70,000,000
capital, controlling practically all the sleeping-cars of
this country and many abroad. The main works are
at the Chicago suburb of Pullman, ten miles south
of the centre of the city, where there are about
twelve thousand population, most of the people being
connected with the works, which are an extensive
general car-building establishment. Pullman was
built as a model town, with every improvement calculated
to add to the comfort and health of the working-people,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">442</a></span>
being also provided with its own library,
theatre, and a tasteful arcade, in which are various
shops. It was at Pullman in 1894 that the great
strike took place which ultimately involved a large
portion of the railways of the country, causing much
rioting and bloodshed, and finally requiring the intervention
of the Federal troops to maintain the peace.
After a protracted period of turmoil, the strike failed.</p>

<p class="center p2">THE CORN CROP.</p>

<p>Chicago is the <i>entrepôt</i> for the great prairie region
spreading from the Alleghenies westward beyond the
Mississippi. Here grows the grain making the wealth
of the land, and feeding the cattle, hogs and sheep
that are poured so liberally into the Union Stock
Yards of the Lake City. Upon the crops of this vast
prairie land depends the prosperity of the country.
Wall Street in New York and the Chicago Board
of Trade are the market barometers of this prosperity,
for the prairie farmer, as he may be rich and able to
spend money, or poor so that he cannot even pay his
debts, controls the financial outlook in America. The
traveller, as he glides upon this universal prairie land,
east, south and west of Chicago, viewing its limitless
fertility seen far away in every direction over the
monotonous level, as if looking across an ocean,
cannot help recalling Wordsworth's pleasant lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"The streams with softest sound are flowing,</p>
<p>The grass you almost hear it growing,</p>
<p>You hear it now, if e'er you can."</p>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">443</a></span></p>

<p>Then, as the crops ripen and are garnered, and
the wealth of the prairie is turned into food for the
world, there comes with the advancing autumn the
ripening of the greatest crop of America, and the
mainstay of the country, the Indian corn. It is
wonderful to think that the first corn crop of the
United States planted by white men at Jamestown,
Virginia, on a field of forty acres in 1608, has grown to
an annual yield approximating twenty-three hundred
million bushels. This prolific crop is the banner
product of the great prairie, and Whittier in his
"Corn Song" has recorded its glories:</p>

<p class="center p2">THE GREAT LAKES.</p>

<p>René Robert Cavelier, the Sieur de La Salle,
was the chief French pilgrim and adventurer in the
seventeenth century who explored the Great Lakes
and valley of the Mississippi, and secured for his
country the vast empire of Louisiana, stretching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">448</a></span>
from Canada to the Gulf. His explorations were
made in 1669 and again in 1678, and like all the
discoverers of that early time he was hunting for the
water way thought to lead to the South Sea and provide
a route to China. The historian Parkman describes
La Salle as one of the most remarkable explorers
whose names live in history; the hero of a
fixed idea and determined purpose; an untiring pilgrim
pushing onward towards the goal he was never
to attain; the pioneer who guided America to the
possession of her richest heritage. Throughout the
northwest his memory is preserved in the names of
rivers, towns, and otherwise, and his maps and narratives
gave the earliest geography of the Lakes and
the vast and prolific region obtained from France in
the Louisiana cession.</p>

<p>The Great Lakes on the northern border of the
United States are the largest bodies of fresh water on
the globe. They carry an enormous commerce,
nearly a hundred thousand men being employed by
the fleet of lake vessels, which approximates two
millions tonnage. At the head of Lake Erie the
waters of Detroit River pour in, draining the upper
lakes, this stream, about twenty-five miles long, flowing
from Lake St. Clair and broadening from a half-mile
to four miles width at its mouth. Lake St.
Clair is elevated five hundred and thirty feet, but is
small, being about twenty-five miles in diameter, and
shallow, only about twenty feet deep. The navigation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">449</a></span>
of its shallows is intricate, and is aided by a long
canal through the shoals at the upper end, where the
St. Clair River discharges, a strait about forty miles
long, flowing south from Lake Huron. This great
lake is at five hundred and eighty feet elevation, and
in places seventeen hundred feet deep, covering
twenty-four thousand square miles, and containing
many islands. At its northern end, Lakes Superior
and Michigan join it by various straits and water
ways beyond Mackinac Island. Westward of Lakes
Ontario and Erie, and between them and Lake
Huron, a long peninsula of the Dominion of Canada
projects southward into the United States, terminating
opposite Detroit. Similarly, to the westward of
Lake Huron, and between it and Lake Michigan, the
State of Michigan has its lower peninsula projecting
upward to Canada. The Canadian projection, which
is part of Ontario Province, is unfortunately located,
being almost surrounded by these expansive lakes,
having bleak, cold winds sweeping across them and
seriously impeding its agriculture. The surface has
little charm of scenery and the population is sparse.
The trunk railways, however, find this an almost
direct route from Western New York to Detroit and
Chicago, and various roads traverse it, coming out
on the Detroit River and the swift-flowing St. Clair
River, which are crossed both by car-ferry and tunnel.
At the outlet of Lake Huron, St. Clair River
is less than a thousand feet wide between Point Edward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">450</a></span>
and Fort Gratiot, and here and at Ports Sarnia
and Huron the low and level shores are lined with
docks, elevators and other accessories of commerce.
This river brings vast amounts of sand down out of
Lake Huron with its swift current, which are deposited
on the St. Clair Flats beyond its mouth, keeping
that lake shallow, and requiring the long ship canal
to maintain navigation. Below Lake St. Clair, the
wider Detroit River presents many fine bits of
scenery, while the city of Detroit spreads for several
miles along the northwestern bank, and has Windsor
opposite, on the Canadian shore. Pretty islands dot
the broadening stream below Detroit, and the varying
width, with the bluffs on the Canadian side, and
the meadows, fields and forests of Michigan, give
lovely views.</p>

<p class="center p2">DETROIT AND MACKINAC.</p>

<p>Detroit means "the strait," and the original Indian
names for the river mean "the place of the
turned channel." The early visitors who reached it
by boat at night or in dark weather, and were inattentive
to the involved currents, always remarked, as
the Indians did before them, that owing to these extraordinary
involutions of the waters, when the sun
appeared again it always seemed to rise in the wrong
place. The French under La Salle were the first
Europeans who passed through the river, and in 1701
the Sieur de la Mothe Cadillac, who received grants
from Louis XIV., came and founded Fort Pontchartrain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">451</a></span>
there, naming it after the French Minister of
Marine, around which a settlement afterwards grew,
to which the French sent colonists at intervals. The
British got possession in 1760, and it successfully resisted
the conspiracy and attacks of the Ojibway Indian
chief Pontiac for over a year, the garrison narrowly
escaping massacre. The United States, after
the Revolution, sent out General St. Clair as Governor,
and his name was given the lake to the northward.
Detroit was a frontier post in the War of
1812, being alternately held by British and Americans.
In 1824 it had about fifteen hundred people
and became a city. It now has three hundred and
fifty thousand population, and its commercial importance
may be estimated from the fact that the whole
enormous traffic of the Lakes passes in front of the
city during the seven months that navigation is open,
the procession of craft often reaching sixty thousand
vessels in the season. Detroit also has extensive and
varied manufactures. It has a gradually rising surface
and broad and well-paved streets on a rectangular
plan, with several avenues radiating from a centre,
like the spokes of a wheel. The central square
is the Campus Martius, an expansion, about a half-mile
from the river, of Woodward Avenue, the chief
street. Here is an elaborate City Hall, the principal
public building, having in front a magnificent Soldiers'
Monument. The suburbs are attractive, and there
are various pleasant parks and rural cemeteries, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">452</a></span>
leading Park of Belle Isle, covering seven hundred
acres, being to the northeastward, with a good view
over Lake St. Clair. Fort Wayne, the elaborate defensive
work of Detroit, is on the river just below
the city, and has a small garrison of regular troops.
It is yet incomplete, and is designed to be the most
extensive fortification on the northern frontier, commanding
the important passage between Lakes Huron
and Erie and the railway routes east and west.</p>

<p>The peninsula of Michigan was originally covered
with the finest forests, so that lumbering has always
been a leading industry of the people. The greater
portion of its pine woods, however, has been cut off,
so that that branch is declining; but its ample supply
of hard woods has made the State a great manufacturer
of furniture, which is shipped all over the
country. Thirty-eight miles west of Detroit, on the
Huron River, is the city of Ann Arbor, with a population
of fifteen thousand. Here are the extensive
buildings of the University of Michigan, the leading
educational establishment of the northwest, attended
by over three thousand students, of whom a large
number are young women. It is richly endowed, and
has departments of law and medicine, as well as of
literature and science, a large library and an observatory.
The State makes a liberal annual contribution
for its support, raised by taxation, it being governed
by eight regents elected by the people. At the
northern extremity of the Michigan Peninsula is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">453</a></span>
Strait of Mackinac, through which Lake Michigan
discharges into Lake Huron. This water way is
about four miles wide. In the strait is Mackinac
Island, about nine miles in circumference, which was
early held by the French on account of its strategic
importance, but, being taken by the English in 1760,
was captured by Pontiac when he organized the Indian
revolt against the British in 1763, and all its
inhabitants massacred. It is now a military post and
reservation of the United States. This rocky and
wooded island contains much picturesque scenery,
and is a favorite summer resort, its weird legends,
fresh breezes, good fishing and clear waters being
the attraction. It was an early post of the northwestern
fur-traders, and here was founded one of the
frontier trading-stations of the Astor Fur Company
in the early nineteenth century by John Jacob Astor
of New York, the building in the little village being
still known as the Astor House.</p>

<p class="center p2">LAKE SUPERIOR.</p>

<p>To the northward of Mackinac, Lake Superior discharges
into Lake Huron through the Sault Sainte
Marie Strait, the "Leap of St. Mary." This strait
of St. Mary is a winding and most beautiful stream,
sixty-two miles long, being a succession of expansions
into lakes and contractions into rivers, dotted
with pretty islands and having some villages on the
banks. The chief attraction is the Sault, or "Leap,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">454</a></span>
which is a rapid of about eighteen feet descent,
the navigation being maintained through capacious
modern systems of locks and ship canals provided by
both the United States and Canada. To the westward
is the great Lake Superior, the largest fresh-water
lake on the globe, three hundred and sixty
miles long and covering thirty-two thousand square
miles, with a coast-line of about fifteen hundred
miles. It is elevated about six hundred feet above
the ocean level, and has a depth averaging one thousand
feet. Nearly two hundred rivers and creeks
flow into it, draining a region of a hundred thousand
square miles. There are a few islands in the eastern
and western portions, but all the centre of the lake is
a vast unbroken sheet of water, and generally of a
low temperature, the deeper waters being only 39°
in summer. The early French missionaries, who
were the first explorers, told their interesting story
of Lake Superior in Paris in 1636, and in their published
account speak of its coasts as resembling a
bended bow, of which the north shore makes the
arc of the bow, the south shore the chord, and the
great Keweenaw Point, projecting far from the
southern shore, represents the arrow. Superior has
generally a rock-bound coast, displaying impressive
beauties of scenery, particularly on the northern
shore, where the beetling crags and cliffs are projected
boldly into the lake along the water's edge.
This northern coast is also much indented by deep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">455</a></span>
bays, bordered by precipitous cliffs, back of which
rise the dark and dreary Laurentian Mountains.
There are also rocky islands scattered near this portion
of the coast, some presenting vast castellated
walls of basalt and others peaks of granite, elevated
a thousand to thirteen hundred feet above the lake.
Nowhere upon the inland waters of North America
is there grander scenery.</p>

<p>The most considerable affluent of Lake Superior
upon its northern coast is the Nepigon River, coming
grandly down cascades and rapids, bringing the
waters of Lake Nepigon, an elliptical lake among
the mountains to the northward covering about four
thousand square miles, bounded by high cliffs, and
elevated over eight hundred feet. It is studded with
islands, has very deep waters, and receives various
streams from the remote northern wilderness. Upon
the northwestern shore of Lake Superior are gigantic
cliffs, surrounding Thunder Bay, a deep indentation
divided from Black Bay by the great projecting
promontory of Thunder Cape, rising nearly fourteen
hundred feet in grand columns of basalt, the summit
containing the crater of an extinct volcano. Across
from it is McKay Mountain, another basaltic Gibraltar,
rising twelve hundred feet from the almost
level plain bordering the bay. Pic Island is between
them, guarding the entrance. The pretty Kaministiquia
River flows through rich prairie lands down
to Thunder Bay, and here is the chief Canadian town
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">456</a></span>
on the lake, Port Arthur. Thirty miles up this river
is the famous Kakabika Falls, where the rocks are
cleft so that the stream tumbles into a chasm one hundred
and thirty feet deep, and then boils along with
rapid current for nearly a half-mile through the fissure,
the sides towering perpendicularly, and in some
places even overhanging their bases. Upon this
river was for many years the well-known Hudson
Bay Company's fur-trading station of Fort William,
which now has grain elevators, and is a suburb of the
spreading settlement of Port Arthur. This was the
beginning of the great portage from Lake Superior
over to the Hudson Bay waters at Fort Garry, on
the Red River in Manitoba, now Winnipeg, the
portage being the present route of the Canadian Pacific
Railway.</p>

<p class="center p2">SAULT SAINTE MARIE TO DULUTH.</p>

<p>The southern shore of Lake Superior is mostly
composed of lowlands, covered with sand, glacial deposits
and clays, which came from the lake during a
former stage of much higher water, when it extended
many miles south of the present boundary. These
lands, while not well adapted to agriculture, contain
rich deposits of copper, iron and other metals and
valuable red sandstones. Around the rapids and
canals at the outlet has gradually grown the town of
Sault Sainte Marie, familiarly known as the "Soo,"
having ten thousand people, and developing important
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">457</a></span>
manufactures from the admirable water-power of
the rapids, which is also utilized for electrical purposes.
An international bridge brings a branch of the Canadian
Pacific Railway over from Canada, on its way to
Minneapolis and St. Paul, with connections southward
to Chicago, and there is also the military post of Fort
Brady. Stately processions of vessels constantly
move through the canals, being locked up or down
when the navigation season is open, and making this
a very animated place, over fifteen thousand ships
passing in the seven months when the canals are free
from ice. The tonnage is the greatest using any system
of canals in the world, far exceeding Suez, and
the recent improvements enable vessels of twenty-one
feet draft to go through the new locks. Both
Governments have expended millions upon these important
public works, which are chiefly employed for
the transport of grain, flour, coal, iron-ores and copper.
The favorite sports at the "Soo" are catching
white fish and "shooting the rapids" in canoes
guided by the Indians, who are very skillful.</p>

<p>About one hundred miles westward from the "Soo,"
on the southern lake shore, there rise cliffs of the red
and other sandstones formed by the edges of nearly
horizontal strata coming out at the border of the lake.
These are the noted Pictured Rocks, rising three
hundred feet, extending for a distance of about five
miles, and worn by frost and storm into fantastic and
romantic forms, displaying vivid hues&mdash;red, blue,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">458</a></span>
yellow, green, brown and gray&mdash;as they have been
stained by the oozing waters carrying the pigments.
At intervals, cascades fall over the rocks. One cliff,
called the Sail Rock, is like a sloop in full sail, and
there are various castles and chapels, and an elaborate
Grand Portal. In the country around is laid much
of the scene of <i>Hiawatha</i>, and at the little lake port
of Munising, nearby, was the site of the wigwam of
the old woman, Nokomis,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="o1">"On the shores of Gitchee Gumee,</p>
<p>Of the shining Big-Sea-Water."</p>
</div></div>

<p>To the westward is the region of iron-ores, and
here is Marquette, named for the great Jesuit missionary
Father Marquette, who was the first founder
of mission settlements in this region, and died in
1675 near the mouth of Marquette River. This
town of fifteen thousand people is on Iron Bay, and
is the chief port of the Marquette, Menominee and
Ishpeming mines. Farther to the westward the great
Keweenaw Peninsula projects, the name meaning in
the Indian dialect the "canoe portage." At its base,
the Portage Lake almost separates it from the mainland,
and a short portage to the westward formerly
carried the canoes over the narrow isthmus. A canal
now enables the lake shipping to pass through without
making the long detour around the outer end of
the peninsula. Upon this rocky peninsula are the
great copper-mines of Michigan, including the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">459</a></span>
Quincy, Tamarack, Osceola, Franklin, Atlantic, and
the Calumet and Hecla. The latter is the world's
leading Copper Company, making over $4,000,000
estimated annual profit, employing five thousand
men, and having the deepest shaft in existence, the
Red Jacket, which has been sunk forty-nine hundred
feet. Houghton, on the southern shore of Portage
Lake, is the leading town of the copper district. To
the southwestward and in the western part of the
Upper Michigan Peninsula is Lake Gogebic, elevated
thirteen hundred feet, in another prolific iron-ore district,
the Gogebic range, which produces Bessemer
ores, and has its shipping port across the Wisconsin
boundary at Ashland, another busy town of fifteen
thousand people at the head of Chequamegon Bay.
Out in front are the Apostle Islands, a picturesque
group, and to the westward the head of Lake Superior
gradually narrows in the Fond du Lac, or end
of the lake, where are situated its leading ports,
Superior City in Wisconsin and Duluth in Minnesota.</p>

<p>Here in the seventeenth century came the early
French, and in 1680 a trading-post was established
by Daniel du Lhut, afterwards becoming a Hudson
Bay Company Station. The mouth of St. Louis
River and its bay were naturally recognized as important
points for trade, and when the Northern
Pacific Railway was projected Superior City got its
start. The first railroad scheme failed, the panic of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">460</a></span>
1857 came, and the railway project was abandoned
until after the Civil War; and then, when it was renewed,
the terminus was located over on the other
side of the river, the place being named Duluth, after
the French trader. While there has been great
rivalry between them, and Duluth has outstripped
Superior, yet the latter has an extensive trade and
thirty thousand people. Duluth, the "Zenith City
of the Unsalted Seas," as it has been ambitiously
called, was originally projected on Minnesota Point,
a scythe-shaped natural breakwater running out
seven miles into the lake, which protects the harbor,
but the town was subsequently built farther in. There
were about seventy white people in the neighborhood
in 1860, and in 1869 its present site was a
forest, while the railroad, which had many set-backs,
had only brought about three thousand people there
in 1885. The completion of other railway connections
in various directions, the discovery of iron deposits,
and the recognition of its advantageous position
for traffic, subsequently gave Duluth rapid
growth, so that it now has eighty thousand people,
and is the greatest port on the lake. It is finely
situated, the harbor being spacious and lined with
docks and warehouses, and it has many substantial
buildings. Back of the city a terrace rises some four
hundred feet, an old shore line of Lake Superior
when the water was at much higher level, and here
is the Boulevard Drive, giving splendid views over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">461</a></span>
the town and lake. The vast extent of wheat lands
to the westward and the prolific iron-ore district to
the northward give Duluth an enormous trade. Its
railways lead up to the Messabi and Vermillion ranges,
now the greatest producers of Lake Superior iron-ores,
the red hematite, most of the output being controlled
by John D. Rockefeller and his associates.
These mines yield the richest ores in the world, and
have made some of the greatest fortunes in Duluth.
Yet they were not discovered until 1891, and then
the lands where they are generally went begging,
because nobody would give the government price for
them, $1.25 per acre. One forty-acre tract, then
abandoned by the man who took it up because he did
not think the pine wood on it was enough to warrant
paying $50 for it, is now the Mountain Iron Mine,
netting Mr. Rockefeller $375,000 annual profit, and
his railroad bringing the ores out gets more than that
sum for freights.</p>

<p class="center p2">THE CITY OF MILWAUKEE.</p>

<p>The early French traders and explorers who came
to the upper lakes naturally ascended their affluents,
and in this way La Salle, Joliet, Hennepin and others
crossed the portages beyond Lake Michigan to the
tributaries of the Mississippi. They came to Green
Bay on the west side of Lake Michigan, ascended
the Fox River and crossed over to the Wisconsin
River. Southward from the Upper Michigan Peninsula
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">462</a></span>
and westward of the lower peninsula of that
State spreads the broad expanse of Lake Michigan,
stretching from Mackinac and Green Bay down to
Chicago. Its western shore is the State of Wisconsin,
extending northward to Lake Superior. When
the French explorers came along and floated down its
chief river, an affluent of the Mississippi, the latter
making the western boundary of the State, they
found the Indian name of the stream to be a word
which, according to the pronunciation, they spelled
in their early narratives "Ouisconsing" and "Misconsin,"
and it finally came out in the present form
of Wisconsin, thus naming the State. The original
meaning was the "wild, rushing red water," from the
hue given by the pine and tamarack forests. La
Salle coasted in his canoe all along the western shore
of Lake Michigan, from Green Bay down to Chicago,
and crossed over to the Mississippi. The traders
established various settlements on that shore which
have grown into active cities, and the principal one,
eighty-five miles north of Chicago, is Milwaukee, its
name derived from the Indian Mannawahkie, meaning
the "good land." A broad harbor, indented
several miles from the lake, was the nucleus of the
city, at the mouth of Milwaukee River, which receives
two tributaries within the town, and thus adds
to the facilities for dockage, while extensive breakwaters
protect the harbor entrance from lake storms.</p>

<p>Milwaukee has three hundred and fifty thousand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">463</a></span>
people, and is the growth mainly of the latter half of
the nineteenth century. It is finely located, with undulating
surface, the streets lined with trees, and the
splendid development of the residential section making
it almost like an extensive park, the foliage and
garden spaces are so extensive and attractive. Its
population is largely German, and its breweries are
famous, exporting their product all over the country.
It has a grand Federal building, costing nearly
$2,000,000, a Romanesque structure in granite, an
elaborate Court-house of brown sandstone, a spacious
City Hall, a magnificent Public Library and Museum,
and many attractive churches and other edifices.
Juneau Park, on a bluff overlooking the lake, commemorates
the first settler, Solomon Juneau, and contains
his statue. Here, in compliment to the large
Scandinavian population of Wisconsin, is also a statue
of Leif Ericsen, who is said to have been in command
of the first detachment of Norsemen who
landed in New England in the eleventh century.
The Forest Home Cemetery at the southwestern
verge of the city is one of the most beautiful in the
country. Milwaukee is familiarly called the "Cream
City" from the light-colored brick made in the neighborhood,
which so largely enter into the construction
of its buildings. It has extensive grain elevators and
flour mills and large manufacturing industries. To
the westward, in a park of four hundred acres, is the
National Soldiers' Home, with accommodation for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">464</a></span>
twenty-four hundred. Its Sheridan Drive along the
lake shore southward is gradually extending, the intention
being to connect with the Sheridan Boulevard
constructed northward from Chicago. The lion of
the city, however, is the great Pabst Brewery, covering
thirty-four acres and producing eight hundred
thousand barrels of beer a year. Twenty miles inland
to the westward is a favorite resort of the Milwaukeans,
the noted Bethesda Spring of Waukesha,
whose waters they find it beneficial to take copiously,
large quantities being also exported throughout
America and Europe for their efficacy in diabetes
and Bright's disease.</p>

<p>The capital of Wisconsin is the city of Madison,
seventy-five miles west of Milwaukee, built on the
isthmus between Lakes Mendota and Monona, thus
giving it an admirable position. It has about twenty
thousand people, and the lake attractions make it a
popular summer resort. The State Capitol is a
handsome building in a spacious park, one of the
wings being occupied by the Wisconsin Historical
Society, with a library of two hundred thousand volumes,
an art gallery and museum. The great structure
of Madison is the University of Wisconsin, the
buildings in a commanding position on University
Hill overlooking the charming Lake Mendota. There
are seventeen hundred students, and its Washburn
Observatory, one of the best in America, has wide
fame.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">465</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2">ASCENDING THE MISSISSIPPI.</p>

<p>Westward from Lake Michigan all the railroads
are laid across the prairie land <i>en route</i> to various
cities on the Mississippi River, several of them having
St. Paul and Minneapolis for their objective points,
although some go by quite roundabout ways. The
great "Father of Waters" comes from Northern
Minnesota, flows over the Falls of St. Anthony at
Minneapolis, and is a river of much scenic attractiveness
down to Dubuque and Rock Island, its width
being usually about three thousand feet, excepting at
the bends, which are wider, the picturesque bluffs
enclosing the valley sometimes rising six hundred
feet high. The railways leading to it traverse the
monotonous level of prairie in Illinois and Wisconsin,
excepting where a stream may make a gorge, and
the face of the country is everywhere almost the
same. The Moline Rapids in the Mississippi above
Rock Island afford good water-power, and here the
Government, owning the island, has established a
large arsenal, which is the base for all the western
army supplies. The admirable location has made
cities on either bank, Rock Island in Illinois and
Davenport in Iowa, both being commercial and
manufacturing centres, and the latter city having
the larger population. The Mississippi flows through
a rather wide valley, with pleasant shores, having
villas dotted on their slopes. The Moline Rapids,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">466</a></span>
which are said to have a water-power rivalling the
aggregate of all the cataracts in New England, descend
twenty-two feet in a distance of fourteen miles.
Above them, the river flows between Illinois and
Iowa, and various flourishing towns are passed, the
largest being Dubuque, with fifty thousand people,
the chief industrial city of Iowa, and a centre of the
lead and zinc manufacture of the Galena district.
This was the first settlement made by white men in
Iowa, the city being named for Julien Dubuque, a
French trader, who came in 1788 with a small
party to work the lead-mines. Iowa is known as
the "Hawkeye State," and its name is of Dakotan
Indian derivation, meaning "drowsy," which, however,
is hardly the proper basis for naming such a
wide-awake Commonwealth. Opposite Dubuque is
the northern boundary of Illinois, and above, the
Mississippi separates Iowa from Wisconsin.</p>

<p>The Mississippi bordering bluffs now rise much
higher and become more picturesque, Eagle Point,
near Dubuque, being elevated three hundred feet.
Prairie du Chien, just above the mouth of Wisconsin
River, was one of the earliest French military posts.
This region was the scene of the "Black Hawk
War," that chief of the Sacs battling to get back
certain lands which in 1832 had been ceded by the
Sac and Fox Indians to the United States. He was
finally defeated back of the western river shore, the
boundary between Iowa and Minnesota being nearby.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">467</a></span>
Minnesota is the "North Star State," and its Indian
name, taken from the river, flowing into the Mississippi
above St. Paul, means the "cloudy water."
The river scenery becomes more and more picturesque
as the Mississippi is ascended, the bluffs rising
to higher elevations. La Crosse is a great lumber
manufacturing town, drawing its timber from both
Minnesota and Wisconsin. Above, where islands
dot the channel, is perhaps the most beautiful section
of the river. Trempealeau Island, five hundred
feet high, commands a magnificent view, and the
Black River flows in through a splendid gorge.
Winona is a prominent grain-shipping town, and at
Wabasha the river expands into the beautiful Lake
Pepin, thirty miles long and from three to five miles
wide, with attractive shores and many popular resorts.
Over the lake rise the bold round headland
of Point No Point on one side and the Maiden Rock
on the other. St. Croix River flows in above on the
eastern bank, making an enlargement known as St.
Croix Lake, and the upper Mississippi is now wholly
within Minnesota, having here at the head of navigation
the famous "Twin Cities" of St. Paul and
Minneapolis.</p>

<p class="center p2">THE FALLS OF ST. ANTHONY</p>

<p>Father Hennepin was the first white man who
penetrated the wilds of Minnesota, and in 1680 he
discovered the great falls of the Mississippi River,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">468</a></span>
to which he gave the name of his patron saint, Anthony
of Padua. The river just below the falls naturally
attracted the attention of the French adventurers
who came to trade with the Sioux, Chippewas
and Dakotas, and the first white man who tarried
and built a house here was a Canadian voyageur,
who came in 1838. In 1841 a French priest established
the Roman Catholic mission of St. Paul on the
bank of the river, and thus the settlement was
named. The admirable water-power of the falls,
which, with their two miles of rapids, descend seventy-eight
feet, afterwards attracted the attention of
millers, lumbermen and other manufacturers, and
this made the settlement of Minneapolis, ten miles
westward and farther up the river, which began in
1849, the name meaning the "city of the waters."
St. Paul grew with rapidity, being encouraged both
by steamboat and afterwards by railway traffic; but
Minneapolis, though started later, subsequently outstripped
it. The two places, rivals yet friends, have
extended towards each other, so as to almost form
one large city, and they now have over four hundred
thousand inhabitants. These "Twin Cities" are
running a rapid race in prosperity, each independently
of the other. St. Paul is rather more of a
trading city, while Minneapolis is an emporium of
sawmills and the greatest flour-mills in the world.
Both are admirably located upon the bluffs rising
above the Mississippi. St. Paul is situated upon a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">469</a></span>
series of ornamental semicircular terraces that are
very attractive, though in some portions rather circumscribed.
Minneapolis is built on a more extensive
plan upon an esplanade overlooking the falls,
and extending to an island in midstream, and also
over upon the opposite northern side of the river.
The Falls of St. Anthony is the most powerful waterfall
in the United States wholly applied to manufacturing
purposes. The entire current of the Mississippi
comes down the rapids and over the falls, the latter
having a descent of about fifty feet. It is protected
by a wall built by the Government across the river,
to prevent the wearing away of the sandstone formation,
there having been serious inroads made, while
the surface is covered with an apron of planks over
which the water runs, with sluiceways alongside to
shoot logs down. However much Father Hennepin
may have admired the beauties of this great cataract,
there is no longer anything picturesque about the
Falls of St. Anthony. Logs jam the upper river,
where the booms catch them for the sawmills, and
subterranean channels conduct the water in various
directions to the mills, and discharge their foaming
streams below. There is no romance in the rumble
of flour-rollers and the buzz of saws, but they mean
a great deal of profitable business. The force exerted
by the falls at low water is estimated at one
hundred and thirty-five thousand horse-power.</p>

<p>St. Paul is the capital of Minnesota, and the State
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">470</a></span>
is building a magnificent new Capitol, constructed of
granite and marble, with a lofty central dome, at a
cost exceeding $2,000,000. There is a fine City
Hall and many imposing and substantial business edifices.
Its especial residence street, Summit Avenue,
is upon a high ridge, parallel with and some distance
back from the Mississippi, the chief dwelling, a large
brownstone mansion, being the home of the leading
railroad prince of the Northwest, President James J.
Hill of the Great Northern Railroad. Here is also
the new and spacious Roman Catholic Seminary of
St. Thomas Aquinas. The old military post of Fort
Snelling is on the river above St. Paul, near the
mouth of Minnesota River. In Minneapolis, the
great building is the City Hall, completed in 1896,
and having a tower rising three hundred and fifty
feet, giving a superb view. The Guaranty Loan
Company's Building is one of the finest office structures
in America, with its roof arranged for a garden,
where concerts are given. Minneapolis has a widely
extended residential section, with hundreds of attractive
mansions in ornamental grounds. Near the
river bank is the University of Minnesota, having
well-equipped buildings and attended by twenty-eight
hundred students.</p>

<p>Minneapolis is the greatest flour manufacturing
city in the world. Its mills, of which there are
some twenty-five, are located along the river near
the falls, and have a daily capacity of over sixty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">471</a></span>
thousand barrels, turning out about eighteen millions
of barrels annually, which are sent all over the globe.
The whole country west and northwest of Minneapolis,
including the Red River Valley, the Dakotas
and Manitoba, is practically a fertile wheat field,
growing the finest grain that is produced in America,
and this makes the prosperity of the city. The
Pillsbury-Washburn Flour Mills Company are the
leading millers. The great Pillsbury A mill, which
turns out ten thousand seven hundred barrels a day,
is the world's champion flour-mill. It is a marvel of
the economical manufacture, the railway cars coming
in laden with wheat, being quickly emptied, and then
filled with loaded flour-barrels and sacks for shipment.
Machinery does practically everything from the
shovelling of wheat out of the car to the packing of
the barrel or sack with the product. This huge mill
stands in relation to the flour trade as Niagara does
to waterfalls. The other great Minneapolis industry
is the lumber trade. Minnesota is well timbered,
a belt of fine forests, chiefly pine, stretching across
it, known as the <i>Coteau des Bois</i>, or "Big Woods,"
an elevated plateau with a rolling surface, having
thousands of lakes scattered through it, fed by
springs, while their outlets go into streams feeding
the Mississippi, down which the logs are floated to
the booms above the falls. The extensive sawmills
will cut over four hundred and fifty millions
of feet of lumber in a year. Thus the flour and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">472</a></span>
lumber have become the chief articles of export from
Minneapolis.</p>

<p>There are several pleasant lakes in the neighborhood,
which are popular resorts of the people of the
"Twin Cities," the largest and most famous being
Minnetonka, the Indian name meaning the "Big
Water." It is a pretty lake, at nearly a thousand
feet elevation, with low, winding and tree-clad shores,
having little islets dotted over its surface, and myriads
of indented bays and jutting peninsulas which extend
its shore line to over a hundred miles, though the extreme
length of the lake is barely seventeen miles.
There are many attractive places on the shores and
islands, and large steamers ply on its bosom. From
this lake the discharge is through the Minnehaha River,
and its Minnehaha Falls, the "Laughing Water,"
poetically praised by Longfellow in Hiawatha. The
beautiful glen in which this graceful cataract is
found has been made a park. The falls are about
fifty feet high, and a critical observer has recorded
that there is "only wanting a little more water to be
one of the most picturesque cascades in the country."
Below the Minnehaha Falls is another on a smaller
scale, which the people thereabout have nicknamed
the "Minnegiggle." Thus sings Longfellow of Minnehaha:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">473</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2">THE SOURCE OF THE MISSISSIPPI.</p>

<p>It was in Minnesota, in 1862, that the terrible Indian
uprising occurred in which the Sioux, exasperated
by the encroachments of the whites, attacked
the western frontier settlements in August, and in
less than two days massacred eight hundred people.
The troops were sent as soon as possible, attacked
and defeated them in two battles, and thirty-eight of
the Indians were executed on one scaffold at Mankato,
on the Minnesota River southwest of Minneapolis,
in December. The State of Minnesota is
said to contain fully ten thousand lakes of all sizes,
the largest being Red Lake in the northern wilderness,
having an area of three hundred and forty
square miles. The surface of the State rises into
what is known as the Itascan plateau in the northern
central part at generally about seventeen hundred
and fifty feet elevation. From this plateau four
rivers flow out in various directions&mdash;the one on the
Western Minnesota boundary, the Red River of the
North, draining the western slope towards Lake
Winnipeg and finally to Hudson Bay; the Rainy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">475</a></span>
River, draining the northern slope also through
Lake Winnipeg to Hudson Bay; the St. Louis
River, flowing eastward to form the head of Lake
Superior, and going thence to the Atlantic; and the
Mississippi River, flowing southward to seek the
Gulf of Mexico. Schoolcraft, the Indian ethnologist
and explorer, named this Itascan plateau, and the
little lake in its heart, where the Mississippi takes its
rise, about two hundred miles north-northwest of
Minneapolis, though the roundabout course of the
river from its source to that city is a much longer
distance, flowing nearly a thousand miles. There
was a good deal of discussion as to whether this lake
was really the head of the great river, as the lake
received several small streams, but Schoolcraft settled
the dispute, and named the lake Itasca, from a
contraction of the Latin words <i>veritas caput</i>, the
"true head." Its elevation is about sixteen hundred
feet, being surrounded by pine-clad hills rising a
hundred feet higher. Out of Itasca Lake the
"Father of Waters" flows with a breadth of about
twelve feet, and a depth ordinarily of less than two
feet. It goes at first northerly, and then makes a
grand curve through a long chain of lakes, describing
a large semicircle to the eastward, and finally southwest,
before it becomes settled as to direction, and
takes its southeast course towards the Falls of St.
Anthony, and onward in its grand progress to the
Gulf.

<p class="center p2">THE ANCIENT LAKE AGASSIZ.</p>

<p>The Minnesota River, rising on the western boundary
of the State, flows nearly five hundred miles in a
deeply carved valley through the "Big Woods" to
the Mississippi. Its source is in the Big Stone Lake,
which, with Lake Traverse to the northward, forms
part of the Dakota boundary. The Red River of
the North, rising in Lake Traverse and gathering
together the streams on the western slope of the
Itascan plateau, flows northward between Minnesota
and North Dakota, and into Manitoba, two hundred
and fifty miles to Lake Winnipeg. This river has
cut its channel in a nearly level plain, and it is
curious that in times of freshet its waters connect,
through Lakes Traverse and the Big Stone, with the
Minnesota, so that steamboats of light draught can
then occasionally pass from the Mississippi waters
north to Lake Winnipeg. It was this rich and level
plain of the valley of the Red River that in the glacial
epoch formed the bed of a vast lake which scientists
have named Lake Agassiz. Its area, as indicated
by well-marked shore-lines and deltas, was a
hundred miles wide and over four hundred miles
long, stretching far into Manitoba, and the waters
were two to four hundred feet deep. It was held up
on the north by the retreating ice-sheet of the great
glacier, the outlet being southward, where a channel
fifty feet deep, fifty miles long and over a mile wide
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">477</a></span>
can now be distinctly traced leading its outflow into
the Minnesota River, whose valley its floods then
greatly enlarged on the way to the Mississippi. The
plain of this lake bed is almost level, descending towards
the northward about a foot to the mile, and
here the ancient lake deposited the thick, rich, black
soils which have made the greatest wheat-growing
region of North America.</p>

<p>The first settlement of Dakota was on the Big
Sioux River at Sioux Falls, where flour-mills and
other manufacturing establishments have gathered
around a fine water-power, and there are nearly fifty
thousand people in the two towns of Sioux Falls in
South Dakota and Sioux City in Iowa. The whole
region to the northward and far over the Canadian
boundary is a land of wheat-fields, with grain elevators
dotting the flat prairie at the railway stations,
for all the roads have lines to tap the lucrative trade
of this prolific region. The Northern Pacific Railway
crosses Red River at Fargo, which, with the
town of Moorhead, both being wheat and flour centres,
has a population of fifteen thousand. To the
westward are the vast "Bonanza" wheat farms of
Dakota, of which the best known is the Dalrymple
farm, covering forty-five thousand acres. Steam-ploughs
make continuous furrows for many miles in
the cultivation, and in the spring the seeding is done.
The whole country is covered with a vast expanse
of waving, yellow grain in the summer, and the harvest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">478</a></span>
comes in August. To the westward flows
James River through a similar district, and the country
beyond rises into the higher plateau stretching
to the Missouri. This fertile wheat-growing region
extends far northward over the Canadian border
forming the Province of Manitoba, the name coming
from Lake Manitoba, which in the Cree Indian dialect
means the "home of Manitou, the Great Spirit."
Its enormous wheat product makes the business of
the flouring-mills of Minneapolis, Duluth and many
other cities, and furnishes a vast stream of grain to
go through the Soo Canal down the lakes and St.
Lawrence, much being exported to Europe.</p>

<p>The Canadian Pacific Railway, which provides the
traffic outlet for Manitoba, comes from the northern
shore of Lake Superior at Port Arthur northwestward
up the valley of the Kaministiquia River, and
its tributary the Wabigoon, the Indian "Stream of
the Lilies." This was the ancient portage, and by
this trail and Winnipeg River, the canoe route of the
Hudson Bay Company voyageurs, Lord Wolseley led
the British army in 1870 to Fort Garry (Winnipeg)
that suppressed Louis Riel's French-Indian half-breed
rebellion, which had possession of the post.
The railway route is through an extensive forest, and
leads near the northern shore of the Lake of the
Woods, crossing its outlet stream at Rat Portage, so
named from the numerous colonies of muskrats, a
town of sawmills standing at the rocky rim of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">479</a></span>
lake, where its waters break through and down rapids
of twenty feet fall to seek Winnipeg River, the Ounipigon
or "muddy water" of the Crees. Here, and at
Keewatin beyond, are grand water-powers, the latter
having mammoth mills that grind the Manitoba wheat
and send the flour to England. Then, emerging from
the forests, the railway crosses the rich black soils of
the Red River Valley, and beyond that river enters
Winnipeg, the "Prairie City" and commercial metropolis
of the Canadian Northwest. For nearly
eight hundred miles this alluvial region spreads west
and northwest of Winnipeg, with varying degrees of
fertility, to the Rocky Mountains. Here, at the
junction of the Assiniboine River, coming from the
remote northwest, with Red River, has grown a Canadian
Chicago of fifty thousand people, developed
almost as if by magic, from the little settlement of
two hundred and forty souls, whom Wolseley found
in 1870, around what was then regarded as the distant
Hudson Bay Company frontier post of Fort
Garry. Its original name when first established was
Fort Gibraltar. The two rivers wander crookedly
over the flat land, and between them the city covers
an extensive surface. A half-dozen railways radiate
in various directions, and there are spacious car-yards
and stations. Winnipeg has an energetic
population, largely Scotch and Americans, but with
picturesque touches given by the copper-colored Indians
and French half-breeds, who wander about in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">480</a></span>
their native costumes, though most of these have
gone away from Red River Valley to the far Northwest.
The city has good streets, many fine buildings
and attractive stores. The Manitoba Government
Buildings adjoin the Assiniboine River, and the
military barracks of Fort Osborne are alongside.
Near the junction of the rivers is the little stone gateway
left standing, which is almost all that remains
of the original trading-post buildings of Fort Garry,
representing the venerable Hudson Bay Company,
chartered by King Charles II. in 1670, that controlled
the whole vast empire of the Canadian Northwest.
This Company was a grant by the king
originally to Prince Rupert and a few associates of a
monopoly of the fur trade over a vast territory in
North America, extending from Lake Superior to
Hudson Bay and the Pacific Ocean. In this way
that portion of British America came to be popularly
known in England as "Prince Rupert's Land." The
great Company existed for nearly two hundred years,
had one hundred and fifty-two trading-posts, and employed
three thousand traders, agents and voyageurs,
and many thousands of Indians. In the bartering
with the red men, the unit of account was the beaver
skin, which was the equivalent of two martens or
twenty muskrats, while the pelt of a silver fox was
five times as valuable as a beaver. In 1869, when
the Dominion of Canada was formed, England bought
the sovereignty of the Company for $1,500,000 and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">481</a></span>
transferred its territory to Canada. The Company
still retains its posts and stores, however, and conducts
throughout the Northwest a mercantile business.
Far to the westward of Winnipeg spread the
fertile prairies of Manitoba and Assiniboia Provinces,
until they gradually blend into the rounded and grass-covered
foothills making the grazing ranges of
Alberta that finally rise into the snow-capped peaks
of the Rockies.</p>

<p class="center p2">DAKOTA AND MONTANA.</p>

<p>Three railways are constructed westward from Red
River to the Rockies and Pacific Ocean,&mdash;the Northern
Pacific and Great Northern in the United States and
the Canadian Pacific beyond the international boundary.
The former cross the plateau to the Upper
Missouri River, and there the Northern Pacific route
reaches Bismarck, the capital of North Dakota,
having a fine Capitol set on a hill, the corner-stone
of which was laid in 1883, with the noted Sioux
chief Sitting Bull assisting. This region not so long
ago knew only soldiers and Indians; but there has
since been a great influx of white settlers, enforcing
the idea of which Whittier has significantly
written:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Behind the squaw's birch-bark canoe,</p>
<p class="i1">The steamer smokes and raves;</p>
<p>And city lots are staked for sale</p>
<p class="i1">Above old Indian graves."</p>
</div></div>

<p>The frontier army post of Fort Lincoln on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">482</a></span>
bluff alongside the river testifies to the time not yet
remote when the Sioux and Crow Indians of the Dakotas
needed a good deal of military control. The
deer, buffalo and antelope then roamed these boundless
prairies, but they have all disappeared. Beyond
the Missouri River is the region of the Dakota
"Bad Lands." The surface rises into sharp conical
elevations known as "buttes," and soon this curious
district of pyramidal hills known as Pyramid Park is
entered, fire and water having had a remarkable
effect upon them. Their red sides are furrowed by
the rains, and smoke issues from some of the crevices.
The lignite and coal deposits underlying this country
have produced subterranean fires that burnt the clays
above until they became brittle and red. There are
ashes and scoriæ in patches, and cinders looking
much like the outcast of an iron furnace. The
buttes are at times isolated and sometimes in rows,
many being of large size. Their sides are often
terraced regularly, and frequently into fantastic
shapes, occasionally appearing as the sloping ramparts
of a fort. There are frequent pot-like holes
among them, filled with reddish, brackish water, and
sometimes excavated in the ground with regularly
square-cut edges. When the railway route cuts into
a butte, its interior is disclosed as a pile of red-burnt
clay fragments mixed with ashes and sand. Little
prairie dogs dodge in and out of their holes, but there
is not much else of life. The boundary is crossed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">483</a></span>
into Montana, and the "Bad Lands" gradually give
place to a grazing section. Here stands up the
great Sentinel Butte, with its reddish-yellow sides,
near the Montana border, and the railway route then
descends from the higher region to the valley of the
Yellowstone.</p>

<p>The Yellowstone River, one of the headwaters of
the Missouri, rises in the National Park, and its fertile
valley is among the leading pasturages of Montana.
Cattle and sheep abound, and the cowboys
are universal, galloping about on energetic little
bronchos, with lariats hanging from the saddle. The
Big Horn River flows in, and an extensive region to
the southward is the Crow Indian reservation, about
three thousand living there. It was here, near Fort
Custer, at a point forty-five miles south of the railroad,
that the terrible massacre took place in June,
1876, by which General Custer and his command of
over two hundred and fifty men were annihilated by
the Sioux. There is now a national cemetery at the
place. We gradually enter the mountain ranges
which are the outposts of the Rockies, and passing
between the Yellowstone range and the Belt Mountains,
reach Livingston, a town of several thousand
people, and a great centre for hunting and fishing, at
the entrance to the Yellowstone National Park. From
here a branch railway turns southward, ascending the
valley of the Yellowstone, going through its first
canyon, known as the "Gate of the Mountain," an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">484</a></span>
impressive rocky gorge, and ascending a steep grade,
so that the floor of the valley rises within the Park to
an elevation of over six thousand feet above the sea.
A second canyon is passed, and on its western side is
a huge peak whose upheaved red rocks have named
it the Cinnabar Mountain. These red rocks are in
strata streaked down its sides with intervening
granite and limestone. One of these, the Devil's
Slide, is conspicuous, its quartzite walls rising high
above the lower strata and making a veritable slide
of great proportions down the mountain. The railroad
ends at Cinnabar, and stages cover the remaining
distance up the Yellowstone to its confluence with
Gardiner River at the Park entrance, and thence to
the Mammoth Hot Springs within the Park, the
tourist headquarters.</p>

<p class="center p2">THE AMERICAN WONDERLAND.</p>

<p>The Yellowstone National Park has been set apart
by Congress as a public reservation and pleasure-ground,
and covers a surface of about fifty-five hundred
square miles within the Rocky Mountains. Most
of the Park is in the northwestern corner of Wyoming,
but there are also small portions in Montana to
the north and Idaho to the west. It is a tract more
remarkable for natural curiosities than an equal area
in any other part of the world, and within it are the
sources of some of the greatest rivers of North
America. The Yellowstone, Gardiner and Madison
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">485</a></span>
Rivers, which are the headwaters of the Missouri,
flow out of the northern and western sides, while on
the southern side originates the Snake River, one of
the sources of the Columbia River of Oregon, and
also the Green River, a branch of the Colorado, flowing
into the Gulf of California. The central portion
of the Park is a broad volcanic plateau, elevated, on
an average, eight thousand feet above the sea, and
surrounded by mountain ridges and peaks, rising to
nearly twelve thousand feet, and covered with snow.
The air is pure and bracing, little rain falls, and the
whole district gives evidence of remarkable volcanic
activity at a comparatively late geological epoch. It
contains the most elevated lake in the world, Yellowstone
Lake. The Yellowstone River flows into this
lake, and then northward through a magnificent canyon
out of the Park. Its most remarkable tributary
within the Park is Tower Creek, flowing through a
narrow and gloomy pass for two miles, called the
Devil's Den, and just before reaching the Yellowstone
having a fall of one hundred and fifty-six feet,
which is surrounded by columns of breccia resembling
towers. There is frost in the Park every month in
the year, owing to the peculiar atmospheric conditions.
The traces of recent volcanic activity are seen in the
geysers, craters and terrace constructions, boiling
springs, deep canyons, petrified trees, obsidian cliffs,
sulphur deposits and similar formations. These geysers
and springs surpass in number and magnitude
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">486</a></span>
those of the rest of the world. There are some five
thousand hot springs, depositing mainly lime and
silica, and over a hundred large geysers, many of
them throwing water columns to heights of from fifty
to two hundred and fifty feet. The most elaborate
colors and ornamentation are formed by the deposits
of the springs and geysers, these curiosities being
mainly in and near the valleys of the Madison and
Gardiner Rivers. An attempt has been made under
Government auspices to have in the Park a huge
game preserve, and within its recesses large numbers
of wild animals are sheltered, including deer, elk,
bears, big-horn sheep, and the last herd of buffalo in
the country. Troops of cavalry and other Government
forces patrol and govern the Park.</p>

<p class="center p2">THE MAMMOTH HOT SPRINGS.</p>

<p>This extraordinary region was first made known in
a way in 1807. A hunter named Coulter visited it,
and getting safely back to civilization, he told such
wonderful stories of the hot springs and geysers
that the unbelieving borderers, in derision, called it
"Coulter's Hell." Others visited it subsequently,
but their remarkable tales were generally regarded
as romances. The first thorough exploration was
made by Prof. Hayden's scientific party for the Government
in 1871, and his report led Congress to reserve
it as a public Park. The visitor generally first
enters the Park at the Mammoth Hot Springs, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">487</a></span>
are near the northern verge of the broad central plateau.
Here are the wonderful terraces built up by
the earlier calcareous deposits of these Springs, covering
an area of several square miles, and in the
present active operations about two hundred acres,
with a dozen or more terraces, and some seventy
flowing springs, the temperature of the water rising
to 165°. The lower terrace extends to the edge of
the gorge of Gardiner River, with high mountain
peaks beyond. The hotel is built on one of the terraces,
with yawning caves and the craters of extinct
geysers at several places in front. The higher terraces
rise in white, streaked with brown and other
tints, as the overflowing, trickling waters may have
colored them. The best idea that can be got of this
place is by conjuring up the popular impression of
the infernal regions with an ample stock of heat and
brimstone. For a long distance, rising from the top
of the gorge of Gardiner River westward in successive
terraces to a height of a thousand feet above the
stream, the entire surface is underlaid with sulphur,
subterranean fires, boiling water and steam, which
make their way out in many places. The earth has
been cracked by the heat into fissures, within which
the waters can be heard boiling and running down
below, and everything on the surface which can be,
is burnt up. Almost every crevice exudes steam and
hot water; sulphur hangs in stalactites from the
caves; and in some places the odors are nearly overpowering.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">488</a></span>
It is no wonder the Indians avoided this
forbidding region, and that the tales told by the early
explorers were disbelieved. Yet it is as attractive as
it is startling. The hot springs form shallow pools,
where the waters run daintily over their rim-like
edges, trickling down upon terrace after terrace,
forming the most beautiful shapes of columns, towers
and coral decorations from the lime deposits, and
painting them with delicious coloring in red, brown,
green, yellow, blue and pink. So long as the waters
run, this decoration continues, but when the flow
ceases, the atmosphere turns everything white, and
the more delicate formations crumble. The whole of
this massive structure has been built up by ages of
the steady though minute deposits of the waters, the
rate being estimated at about one-sixteenth of an
inch in four days. The rocks upon which these calcareous
deposits are made belong to the middle and
lower Cretaceous and Jurassic formations, with probably
carboniferous limestones beneath that put the
deposits in the waters. A dozen different terraces
can be traced successively upward from the river
bank to the highest part of the formation. Two cones
of extinct geysers rise from the deposits, near the
hotel,&mdash;the Liberty Cap, forty-five feet high, and the
Giant's Thumb, somewhat smaller,&mdash;both having been
built up by the deposits from orifices still seen in
their tops, whence the waters have ceased flowing.
All these springs, as deposits are made, shift their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">489</a></span>
locality, so that the scene gradually changes as the
ages pass.</p>

<p>In climbing about this remarkable formation, some
of the most beautiful bits of construction and coloring
nature has ever produced are disclosed. The
Orange Geyser has its sides streaked with orange,
yellow and red from the little wavelets slowly trickling
out of the steaming spring at the top, which goes
off at quick intervals like the exhaust of a steam-engine.
At the Stalactite Cave the flowing waters
add green to the other colors, and also scale the rocks
in places like the back of a fish, while below hang
stalactites with water dropping from them. The roof
of the cave is full of beautiful formations. The
water is very hot when it starts from the top, but
becomes quite cold when it has finished its journey
down. One of the finest formations is Cleopatra's
Bath, with Cupid's Cave beneath, the way to them
being through Antony's Gate, all built up of the deposits.
Here rich coloring is painted on the rocks,
with hot water and steam amply supplied to the bath,
which has 154° temperature at the outer verge. All
the springs form flat basins with turned-up edges,
over which the waters flow, and trickling down the
front of the terrace, paint it. When the flow ceases,
and the surface has been made snowy white by the
atmosphere, it becomes a spongy and beautiful coral,
crumbling when touched, and into which the foot
sinks when walked upon. The aggregation of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">490</a></span>
currents run in streams over terrace after terrace,
spread out to the width of hundreds of feet, painting
them all, and then seeking the Gardiner River, flowing
through a deep gorge in front of the formation.
Everything subjected to the overflow of these currents
gets coated by the deposits, so that visitors
have many small articles coated to carry away as
curiosities.</p>

<p>Among the many beautiful formations made by
these Hot Springs, the most elaborate and ornamental
are the Pulpit Terraces. These are a succession
of magnificent terraces, fifty feet high, with
beautifully colored columnar supports. There is a
large pulpit, and in front, on a lower level, the font,
with the water running over its edges. The pulpit,
having been formed by a spring that has ceased action,
is white, while the font is streaked in red and
brown. Finely carved vases filled with water stand
below, and alongside the pulpit there is an inclined
surface, whitened and spread in wrinkles like the
drifted snow, which requires very little imagination
to picture as a magnificent curtain. Beyond is a
blackened border like a second curtain, the coloring
being made by a spring impregnated with arsenic.
In front of this gorgeous display the surface is hot
and cracked into fissures, with bubbling streams of
steaming water running through it, and great pools
fuming into new basins with turned-up edges, over
which the hot water runs. Upon one of these pools
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">491</a></span>
seems to be a deposit of transparent gelatine, looking
like the albumen of an egg, streaked into fantastic
shapes by elongated bubbles. Everywhere are
surfaces, over which the water runs, that are covered
with regular formations like fish scales. It is impossible
to adequately describe this extraordinary place,
combining the supposed peculiarities and terrors of
the infernal regions with the most beautiful forms
and colors in decoration. The great hill made by
these Hot Springs was, from its prevailing color,
named the White Mountain by Hayden. The
springs extend all the way down to the river bank,
and there are some even in the river bed. It is a
common experiment of the angler to hook a small
fish in the cold water of the river, and then, without
changing position, to swing him on the hook over
into the basin of one of these hot springs to cook
him. The formation of the terraces is wedge-shaped,
and runs up into a gulch between the higher mountains,
which have pines scattered over them, and also
grow some grass in sheltered nooks. It is said that
the volume of the springs is gradually diminishing.</p>

<p class="center p2">THE NORRIS GEYSER BASIN.</p>

<p>The route southward into the Park crosses mountain
ridges and over stretches of lava and ashes and
other volcanic formations, through woods and past
gorges, and reaches the Obsidian Creek, which flows
near the Obsidian Cliff. This remarkable structure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">492</a></span>
is a mountain of black glass of volcanic formation,
rising six hundred feet, with the road hewn along its
edge. It looks as if a series of blasting explosions
had blown its face into pieces, smashing the glass
into great heaps of <i>débris</i> that have fallen down in
front. The formation is columnar, rising from a
morass adjoining Beaver Lake, which is a mile long.
The divide is thus crossed between the Gardiner and
Gibbon Rivers, the latter flowing into the Madison,
and here, twenty-five miles from the Mammoth Hot
Springs, is the Norris Geyser Basin. In approaching,
seen over the low trees, the place looks much
like the manufacturing quarter of a city, steam jets
rising out of many orifices, and a hissing being heard
as of sundry engine exhausts. The basin covers
about one hundred and fifty acres, and is depressed
below the general level. The whole surface is lime,
silica, sulphur and sand, fused together and baked
hard by the great heat, cracked into fissures, and, as
it is walked over, giving out hollow sounds, showing
that beneath are subterranean caves and passages in
which boil huge cauldrons. There is a background
formed by the bleak-looking mountains of the Quadrate
range, having snow upon their tops and sides.
The steam blows off with the noise of a hundred exhaust
pipes, and little geysers boil everywhere, occasionally
spurting up like the bursting of a boiler. In
one place on the hillside the escaping steam from the
"Steamboat" keeps up a loud and steady roar; in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">493</a></span>
another is the deeper tone of the "Black Growler."
As a general thing, the higher vents on the hill give
off steam only, while the lower ones are geysers.
The trees are coated with the deposits, the surface is
hot, and all underneath seems an immense mass of
boiling water, impregnated with sulphur, giving off
powerful odors, while brimstone and lime-dust encrust
everything, and a large amount of valuable
steam-power goes to waste.</p>

<p>This is the smallest of the basins, having few
large geysers. Most of them are little ones, spurting
every few minutes, and with some view to
economy, whereby the water, after being blown out
of the crater to a brief height, runs back into the
orifice again, ready to be ejected by the next explosion.
A mud geyser here throws up large quantities
of dirty white paint in several spouting jets, the
eruption continuing ten minutes, when nearly all the
water runs back again, leaving the crater entirely
bare, and its rounded, water-worn rocks exposed.
The "Emerald Pool" is the wide crater of an old
geyser, filled with hot water of a beautiful green
color, constantly boiling, but never getting as far as
an eruption. Probably the best geyser on exhibition
in this basin is the "Minute Man," which, at intervals
of about one minute, spouts for ten or twelve
seconds, the column rising thirty feet, and the rest of
the time it blows off steam. The "Vixen" is a
coquette which is delightfully irregular, never going
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">494</a></span>
off when watched, but when the back is turned suddenly
sending out a column sixty feet high. The
great geyser here is the "Monarch," standing in a
hill from which it has blown out the entire side, and
once a day discharging an enormous amount of water
over one hundred feet high, and continuing nearly a
half-hour. Its column comes from two huge orifices,
the surplus water running down quite a large brook.
When quiet, this geyser industriously boils like a big
tea-kettle. There are plenty of "paint pots" and
sulphur springs, and the visitors coax up lazy geysers
by throwing stones into them,&mdash;a method
usually making the small ones go to work, as if
angry at the treatment.</p>

<p class="center p2">THE LOWER AND MIDDLE BASINS.</p>

<p>Through the long deep canyon of the Gibbon
River, and up over the mountain top, giving a distant
view of the Gibbon Falls, a cataract of eighty
feet far down in the valley, the road crosses another
divide to a stream in the worst portion of this Satanic
domain, which has not been inappropriately
named the Firehole River. This unites with the
Gibbon to form the Madison River, one of the
sources of the Missouri. Miles ahead, the steam
from the Firehole Geyser Basins can be seen rising
in clouds among the distant hills. Beyond, the view
is closed by the Teton Mountains, far to the southwest,
rising fourteen thousand feet, the Continental
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">495</a></span>
divide and backbone of North America, the highest
Rocky Mountain range, on the other side of which is
the Snake River, whose waters go off to the Pacific.
The Firehole River is a stream of ample current,
with beautifully transparent blue water bubbling over
a bed of discolored stones and lava. Its waters are
all the outflow of geysers and hot springs, impregnated
with everything this forbidding region produces;
pretty to look at, but bitter as the waters of
Marah. Along this river, geysers are liberally distributed
at intervals for ten miles, being, for convenience
of description, divided into the Lower, Middle
and Upper Geyser Basins. The Lower Basin, the
first reached, has myriads of steam jets rising from
a surface of some three square miles of desolate geyserite
deposits. There are about seven hundred
springs and geysers here, most of them small. The
Fountain Geyser throws a broad low stream of many
interlacing jets every two to three hours, lasting
about fifteen minutes. The "Thud" Geyser has a
crater one hundred and fifty feet in diameter, having
a smaller rim inside, within which the geyser operates,
throwing a column of sixty feet with a heavy
and regular "thud" underground, though it has no
fixed period, and is irregular in action. This basin
has a generous supply of mud geysers, known as the
"paint pots," which eject brilliantly colored muds
with the consistency and look of paint, the prevailing
hues being red, white, yellow and pink.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">496</a></span></p>

<p>About three miles to the southwest, farther up the
Firehole River, is the Middle Geyser Basin. It is a
locality covering some fifty acres, close to the river,
and contains the greatest geyser in the world. The
name of Hell's Half Acre was given this place in the
early explorations, and still sticks. The surface is
composed mainly of hot ashes, with streams of boiling
water running over it. The whole basin is filled
with hot springs, and surrounded by timbered hills,
at the foot of which is the Prismatic Lake, its beautiful
green and blue waters shading off into a deposit
of bright red paint running down to the river. The
great Excelsior Geyser is a fountain of enormous
power but uncertain periods, which when at work
throws out such immense amounts of water as to
double the flow of the river. Its crater is a hundred
yards wide, with water violently boiling in the centre
all the time and a steady outflow. The sides of the
crater are beautifully colored by the deposits, which
are largely of sulphur. It is a geyser of modern
origin, having developed from a hot spring within
the memory of Park denizens. It throws a column
over two hundred feet high, and while quiet at times
for years, occasionally bursts forth, though having no
fixed period. In close connection to the westward is
the seething cauldron which is the immediate Hell's
Half Acre, that being about its area&mdash;a beautiful but
terrible lake, steam constantly rising from the surface,
which boils furiously and sends copious streams
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">497</a></span>
over the edges. This is an uncanny spot, with
treacherous footing around, and about the hottest
place in the Park.</p>

<p class="center p2">THE UPPER FIREHOLE BASIN.</p>

<p>For five miles along the desolate shores of Firehole
River the course is now taken in a region of
mostly extinct geysers, yet with active hot springs
and steam jets, and having ashes and cinders covering
wide spaces. Ahead is the largest collection of
geysers in the world, with clouds of steam overhanging&mdash;the
Upper Firehole Basin. Hot water runs
over the earth, and the "paint pots" color the surface
in variegated hues. Here are some forty of the
greatest geysers in existence, in a region covering
two or three square miles, all of them located near
the river, and their outflow making its initial current.
The basin is at seventy-three hundred feet elevation
above the sea. When the author visited this extraordinary
place the guide, halting at the verge, said:
"Now I have brought you to the front door of hell."
He was asked if there were any Indians about there,
and solemnly replied: "No Indian ever comes into
this country unless he is blind; only the white man
is fool enough to come;" then after a moment's pause
he continued, "And I get paid for it, I do." The
great stand-by of this Upper Basin, and the geyser
that is first visited, is "Old Faithful," near its southern
or upper end. This most reliable geyser, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">498</a></span>
always goes off at the time appointed, is a flat-topped
and gently rising cone about two hundred feet in diameter,
and elevated towards the centre about twenty
feet. The tube is an orifice of eight feet by two
feet wide in the centre of this cone, with water-worn
and rounded rocks enclosing it. Steam escapes all
the time, and the hard, scaly and laminated surface
around it seems hollow as you walk across, while beneath
there are grumblings and dull explosions,
giving warning of the approaching outburst. Several
mounds of extinct geysers are near, with steam
issuing from one of them, but all have long since
gone out of active business. Soon "Old Faithful"
gives the premonitory symptoms of an eruption.
The steam jet increases, and also the internal rumblings.
Then a little spurt of hot water comes,
hastily receding with a growl, followed by more
steam, and after an interval more growling, finally developing
into repeated little spurts of hot water, occupying
several minutes. Then the geyser suddenly
explodes, throwing quick jets higher and higher into
the air, until the column rises in a grand fountain to
the height of about one hundred and fifty feet, the
stream inclined to the northward, and falling over in
great splashes upon that side of the cone, dense
clouds of steam and spray being carried by the wind,
upon which the sun paints a rainbow. After some
four minutes the grand jet dies gradually down to a
height of about thirty feet, continuing at that elevation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">499</a></span>
for a brief time, with quickly repeated impulses.
When six minutes have elapsed, with an expiring
leap the water mounts to a height of fifty feet,
there is a final outburst of steam, and all is over. A
deluge of hot water rushes down to the Firehole
River; and thus "Old Faithful" keeps it up regularly
every hour. The eruption being ended, you
can look down into the abyss whence it came.
Through the hot steam, rushing out with a strong
draught, there is a view far down into the rocky
recesses of the geyser. The water left by the eruption
stands about in transparent shallow pools, and is
tinted a pale blue. "Old Faithful's" mound is built
up of layers of geyserite&mdash;hard, brittle, porous, full
of crevices, and having all about little basins with
turned-up rims that retain the water. This geyser
is the favorite in the region, not only because of its
regular performance, but possibly because its odors
are somewhat less sulphurous than those emanating
elsewhere.</p>

<p>The geysers of the Upper Basin contribute practically
the whole current of the Firehole River, their
outflow sending into the stream ten million gallons
daily. Across the river to the northward, close to
the bank, is the Beehive, its tube looking like a huge
bird's nest, enclosed by a pile of geyserite resembling
a beehive, three feet high and about four feet in diameter.
Nearby is a vent from which steam, escaping
a few minutes before the eruption, gives notice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">500</a></span>
of its coming. The water column shoots up two
hundred feet, with clouds of steam, but it is quite uncertain,
spouting once or twice in twenty-four hours,
and usually at night. Behind the Beehive are the
Lion, the Lioness, and their two Cubs, and to the
eastward of the latter the Giantess. The Lion group
has only uncertain and small action, while the Giantess
is on the summit of a mound fifty feet high,
with a depressed crater, measuring eighteen by
twenty-four feet, and usually filled with dark-blue
water. This is the slowest of all the geysers in getting
to work, acting only at fortnightly intervals, but
each eruption continues the greater part of the day,
with usually long-previous notice by violent boiling
and internal rumblings. When it comes, the explosion
is terrific, the column mounting two hundred
and fifty feet, a perfect water-spout the full size of
the crater, with a half-dozen distinct jets forced
through it. To the northwest of the Lion and across
the river is the Castle, so named from the castellated
construction of its crater. It stands upon an elevation,
the side towards the Firehole falling off in a
series of rude steps. The tube is elevated about ten
feet within the castle and is four feet in diameter. It
is of uncertain eruption, sometimes playing daily
and sometimes every other day, throwing a column
of one hundred and fifty feet, falling in a sparkling
shower, continuing about forty minutes, and then
tapering off in a series of insignificant spurts. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">501</a></span>
Saw-Mill is not far away, rather insignificant, its
tube being only six inches in diameter, set in a
saucer-like crater about twenty feet across; but its
water column, thrown forty feet high, gives the
peculiar sounds of a saw, caused by the action of
puffs of steam coming out alternately with the water
jets. It generally acts in unison with the Grand
Geyser, a quarter of a mile northward, which goes
off about once a day. The Grand Geyser in action
is most powerful, causing the earth to tremble, while
there are fearful thumping noises beneath. The
water in the crater suddenly recedes, and then
quickly spurts upward in a solid column for two hundred
feet, with steam rising in puffs above. The
column seems to be composed of numerous separate
jets, falling back with a thundering sound into the
funnel. The outburst continues a few minutes, stops
as suddenly as it starts, and is repeated six or eight
times, each growing less powerful. Along the river
bank nearby are the Wash Tubs, small basins ten
feet in diameter, each with an orifice in the bottom.
If the clothes are put in, the washing progresses
finely until suddenly out goes the water, and with it
all the garments, sucked down the hole. After awhile
the basin fills again, and back come the clothes,
though sometimes they are very dilatory in returning.
The Devil's Well, about fifty feet away, is
usually accused of complicity in this movement. It
is a broad and placid basin of hot water, with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">502</a></span>
beautiful blue tinge, in which tourists sometimes boil
their eggs and potatoes. It is sentinelled by the
Comet Geyser, exploding several times daily, but
through an orifice so large that it does not throw a
very high column.</p>

<p>The great geyser of this Upper Basin is the Giant.
It has a broken cone set upon an almost level surface,
with the enclosing formation fallen away on one
side, the interior being lined with brilliant colors like
a tessellated pavement. It is somewhat uncertain in
movement, but usually goes off every fourth day.
It gives ample notice, certain "Little Devils" adjoining,
and a vent in the side of the crater, boiling
some time before it sends up the enormous column
which plays ninety minutes. The outburst, when it
starts, comes like a tornado, and the stream from it
runs into and more than doubles the current of the
river. The column is eight feet in diameter, rises
two hundred and fifty feet at first, and is afterwards
maintained at two hundred feet. There is a deafening
noise, and the steam clouds seem to cover half
the valley. The column goes up perfectly straight,
and falls back around the cone with a deluge of hot
water. The Catfish, a small geyser, is nearby, and
to the northward a short distance is the Grotto. This
is an odd formation, its crater perforated with orifices
around a low, elongated mound, which point in different
directions; and when it goes off at six-hour
intervals, the eruption is by streams at an angle,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">503</a></span>
giving a curious sort of churning motion to the water
column, which rises forty feet, continuing twenty
minutes. The Riverside has a little crater on a terraced
mound just at the river's edge, and is a small,
irregular but vigorous spouter, throwing a stream
sixty feet. The Fan has five spreading tubes,
arranged so that they make a huge fan-like eruption,
one hundred feet high in the centre, this display,
given three or four times a day, continuing about
fifteen minutes. The Splendid plays a jet two hundred
feet high every three hours, continuing ten
minutes, and may be spurred to quicker action.
The Pyramid and the Punch Bowl are geysers that
have ceased operations. The former is now only a
steam-jet, and the latter, on a flat mound, is an elegant
blue pool, elevated several feet, and having a
serrated edge. The Morning Glory Spring, named
from its resemblance to the convolvulus, is a beautiful
and most delicately tinted pool. The investigators
of these geysers have been able to get the temperature
at a depth of seventy feet within the tubes, and
find that under the pressure there exerted the boiling-point
is 250°. Upon this fact is based the theory
of the operation of the geyser. The boiling-point
under pressure at the bottom of a long tube being
much higher than at the top, the expansive force
of the steam there suddenly generated drives out
violently the water above it in the tube, and hence
the explosive spouting.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">504</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2">YELLOWSTONE FALLS AND CANYON.</p>

<p>The National Park, besides the extraordinary geyser
and hot-spring formations exhibits the grand
scenery of the Yellowstone Falls and Canyon. The
Yellowstone River has its source in Bridger Lake, to
the southeast of the Park, and flows northward in a
broad valley between generally snow-capped mountain
ridges of volcanic origin, with some of the peaks
rising over eleven thousand feet. It is a sluggish
stream, with heavily timbered banks, much of the
initial valley being marshy, and it flows into the Yellowstone
Lake, the largest sheet of water at a high
elevation in North America. This lake has bays indented
in its western and southern shores, giving the
irregular outline somewhat the appearance of a human
hand, and there are five of them, called the "Thumb"
and the "Fingers." The thumb of this distorted
hand is thicker than its length, the forefinger is detached
and shrivelled, the middle finger has also been
badly treated, and the much swollen little finger is
the biggest of all, thus making a very demoralized
hand. The trail eastward over from the Upper Firehole
Geyser Basin comes out on the West Thumb of
the lake, mounting the Continental Divide on the
way, and crossing it twice as it makes a curious loop
to the northward, the second crossing being at eighty-five
hundred feet elevation, whence the trail descends
to the West Thumb. Yellowstone Lake is at seventy-seven
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">505</a></span>
hundred and forty feet elevation, and covers
about one hundred and fifty square miles, having a
hundred miles of coast-line. The scenery is tame,
the shores being usually gentle slopes, with much
marsh and pine woods. Islands dot the blue waters,
and waterfowl frequent the marshes. The most elevated
portion of the immediate environment is Flat
Mountain, on the southwestern side, rising five hundred
feet, but beyond the eastern shore are some of
the highest peaks of the Park, exceeding eleven
thousand feet. Hot springs adjoin the West Thumb,
and there is an actual geyser crater in the lake itself.
Towards the northern end the shores gradually contract
into the narrow and shallow Yellowstone River,
which flows towards the northwest after first leaving
the lake, having occasional hot springs, geysers,
paint pots and steam jets at work, with large adjacent
surfaces of geyserite and sulphur. The chief
curiosity in operation is the Giant's Cauldron, boiling
furiously, and with a roar that can be heard far
away. The pretty Alum Creek is crossed, its waters,
thus tainted, giving the name. South of this the
Yellowstone is generally placid, winding for a dozen
miles sluggishly through prairie and timbered hills,
but now it contracts and rushes for a mile down
rapids and over pretty cascades to the Upper Fall.</p>

<p>Restricted to a width of but eighty feet, the river
shoots far over this fall, the current being thrown
outward, indicating there must be room to pass behind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">506</a></span>
it. The fall is one hundred and twenty feet,
and suddenly turning a right angle at its foot, the
stream of beautiful green passes through a not very
deep canyon. The appearance of the surrounding
cliffs is quite Alpine, though the rocks forming the
cascade constantly suffer from erosion. About a
half-mile below is the great Lower Falls of the Yellowstone.
Before reaching it, a little stream comes
into the river over the Crystal Fall, about eighty feet
high, rushing down a gorge forming a perfect grotto
in the side of the canyon, extending some distance
under the overhanging rocks. The surface of the
plateau gradually ascends as the Lower Falls are
approached, while the river bed descends, and this
makes a deep canyon, brilliantly colored, generally a
light yellow (thus naming the river), but in many
portions white, like marble, with patches of orange,
the whole being streaked and spotted with the dark-gray
rocks, whose sombre color in this region is produced
by atmospheric action. The river rushes to
the brink of the Lower Fall, and where it goes over,
the current is not over a hundred feet wide, the descent
of the cataract being about three hundred feet,
and the column of falling waters dividing into separate
white streaks, which are lost in clouds of spray
before reaching the bottom. Only a small amount of
water usually goes over, about twelve hundred cubic
feet in a second. Before the plunge the water forms
a basin of dark-green color, and both blue and green
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">507</a></span>
tints mingle with the prevailing white of the cascade.
Towards sunset, when viewed from below, there are
admirable rainbow effects. The river is quite narrow
as it flows away along the bottom of the canyon,
which now becomes deep and large. The grand view
of this beautiful picture is from Point Lookout, a
half-mile below the falls. Unlike any other of the
world's great waterfalls, this cascade, while a part,
ceases to be the chief feature of the scene. It is the
vivid coloring and remarkable formation of the sides
of the canyon that make the chief impression.
These change as the sun gives light and shadow, the
morning differing from noon and noon from night.
It is impossible to reproduce or properly describe the
beautiful hues in this wonderful picture. The prevailing
tint is a light yellow, almost sulphur color,
with veins of white marble and bright red streaked
through it. The colors blend admirably, while the
cascade in the background seems enclosed in a setting
of chocolate-brown rocks, contrasting picturesquely
with the brighter foreground. Throughout
the grand scene, great rocky columns and pinnacles
arise, their brilliant hues maintained to the tops, and
the scattered pines clinging to these huge columnar
formations give a green tinge to parts of the picture.
The <i>débris</i>, forming an inclined base about half-way
down, is colored as brilliantly as the rocks above,
from which it has fallen. In the view over the canyon
from Point Lookout, the contracted white streak
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">508</a></span>
of the cascade above the spray cloud is but a small
part of the background, while the river below is only
a narrow green ribbon, edged by these brilliant hues.
Some distance farther down the canyon, another outlook
at Inspiration Point gives a striking view from
an elevation fifteen hundred feet above the river of
the gorgeous coloring of the upper canyon.</p>

<p>This grand Canyon of the Yellowstone extends, as
the river flows, a distance of about twenty-four miles.
It is a depression in a volcanic plateau elevated
about eight thousand feet above the sea, and gradually
declining towards the northern end of the canyon.
Above the Upper Fall the river level is almost
at the top of the plateau, and the falls and rapids depress
the stream bed about thirteen hundred feet.
About midway along the canyon, on the western side,
is Washburne Mountain, the surface from it declining
in both directions, so that there the canyon is deepest,
measuring twelve hundred feet. Across the top, the
width varies from four hundred to sixteen hundred
yards, the angle of slope down to the bottom being
fully 45°, and often much steeper, in some cases
almost perpendicular where the top width is narrowest.
This Grand Canyon is the beautiful beginning, as it
were, of the largest river in the world,&mdash;the Missouri
and the Mississippi. Upon the trail in the
southern part of the National Park which goes over
from the Firehole River to the West Thumb, and at
quite an elevation upon the Continental Divide, there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">509</a></span>
is a quiet little sheet of water, having two small
streams flowing from its opposite sides. To the
eastward a babbling brook goes down into the West
Thumb of the Yellowstone Lake, while to the southwest
another small creek flows over the boulders towards
Shoshone Lake. This scanty sheet of water,
properly named the Two-Ocean Pond, actually feeds
both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The one
stream gets its outlet through the Mississippi and
the other through the Columbia River of Oregon.</p>

<p class="center p2">WESTWARD THE COURSE OF EMPIRE.</p>

<p>Here, in the Yellowstone National Park, with the
waters flowing towards both the rising and the setting
sun, is the backbone of the American Continent. Beyond
it the country stretches through the spacious
Rocky Mountain ranges to the Pacific. What is herein
described gives an idea of the vast empire ceded to the
United States by France in the early nineteenth century,
and this Great Northwest is gradually becoming
the masterful ruling section of the country. When
Bishop Berkeley, in the early eighteenth century,
sitting by the Atlantic Ocean waves at Newport,
composed his famous lyric on the "course of empire,"
he little thought how typical it was to become more
than a century after his death. He was musing then
"On the Prospect of Planting Arts and Learning in
America." The Arts and the Learning have had
vigorous American growth, but his Muse predicted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">510</a></span>
a greater empire than any one could have then
imagined.</p>
